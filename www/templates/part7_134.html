                    <h1>Going to Gethsemane</h1>

                    <p>When Jesus had spoken these words they went out (from the upper room) and went over the brook of Kidron, into the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('mountofolives')">Mount of Olives</a>.</p>

                    <p>He and his disciples entered into a garden and came to a place called Gethsemane. And when they had come to this place he sat the disciples down and asked them to pray. He told them to pray that they would not fall into temptation.</p>

                    <p>Then he took Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee, James and John, and moved about a stones throw from the other <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">disciples</a>, and he began to be greatly amazed and sorrowful and very troubled.</p>

                    <p>He kneeled down and fell on his face, and prayed that if is were possible that the hour might pass away from him. He said</p>

                    <p>Abba, my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. All things are possible with you. If you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not what I want, but what you want. Not my will, but your will be done.</p>

                    <p>And there appeared unto him and <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('angel')">angel</a> from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</p>

                    <p>And when he rose up from his prayer, he came to where his disciples were and found them sleeping.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>Why are you sleeping? Rise up and pray that you do not enter into temptation.</p>

                    <p>Watch and pray, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>

                    <p>And Jesus went the second time to pray, saying the same words he had said before:</p>

                    <p>My Father, if this cannot pass away, unless I drink it, your will be done.</p>

                    <img src="img/romesidenav.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="romesidenav" title="romesidenav" />
                    <p>And Jesus came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy.   And they did not know what to say to Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Jesus left the third time to pray. And he prayed as he had the first two times, and when he returned to the disciples, they were asleep.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to the disciples:</p>

                    <p>So far as I am concerned you can continue to sleep for now. Take your rest, for the time for you to be of comfort and assistance has passed.</p>

                    <p>But as far as you are concerned, Look, the hour has come and the Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Get up and let's be going. Look, the one who is going to betray me is here.</p>
