                    <h1>He Shall Draw All Men To Him</h1>

                    <p>There were <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('greek')">Greek</a> converts who had come up to the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('feast')">feast</a> to worship.  They came to Philip, who was from <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('bethsaida')">Bethsaida</a> of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('galilee')">Galilee</a>, and asked to see Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Philip went and told Andrew, and together they went and told Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.</p>

                    <p>Listen carefully to the truth I am about to tell you, for if a grain of wheat does not fall into the ground, it remains like it is; but if the wheat falls to the earth and dies, it bears much fruit.</p>

                    <p>He who loves his life will lose it, and he who loses his life in this world will keep it for <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('eternal')">eternal life</a>.</p>

                    <p>If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there the servant will be also. If any man serves me, the Father will honor him.</p>

                    <img src="img/greekmonastery.png" class="img-responsive" name="greekmonastery" title="greekmonastery" />
                    <p>What should I say? Save me from this hour?</p>

                    <p>But this is why I came into the world.</p>

                    <p>Rather, Father, glorify your name.</p>

                    <p>After Jesus said this there was a voice out of heaven saying:</p>

                    <p>I have both glorified it and I will glorify it again.</p>

                    <p>The multitude that was standing near Jesus heard it and said that it had thundered.</p>

                    <p>Others said an <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('angel')">angel</a> had spoken to him.</p>
                    <img src="img/greekmonk.png" class="img-responsive" name="greekmonk" title="greekmonk" />
                    <p>Jesus answered them:</p>

                    <p>This voice has come for your sakes not mine.</p>

                    <p>Now is judgment come to the world.</p>

                    <p>Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>

                    <p>Then Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>If I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself. He said this to signify what sort of death he should die.</p>

                    <p>The multitude answered him:</p>

                    <p>We have heard that the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('christ')">Christ</a> abides forever, so why are you saying:</p>

                    <p>The Son of man must be lifted up?</p>

                    <p>Who is the Son of man?</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>The light is going to be with you for only a little while longer. Walk while you have light, so that the darkness does not overtake you.</p>

                    <p>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.</p>

                    <p>After speaking these things Jesus left them and hid himself from them.</p>

                    <p>Even though he had made many signs and performed miracles among them, they still did not believe in him. This was a fulfillment of the words of the prophet <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('isaiah')">Isaiah</a> who said:</p>

                    <p>Who has believed our testimony? Who has had the mighty works of God revealed to him?</p>

                    <p>This was the reason they could not believe. As <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('isaiah')">Isaiah</a> said:</p>

                    <p>He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their hearts.</p>

                    <p>Some of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> believed in Jesus but were afraid to confess it publicly because they feared that they would be expelled from the synagogue.</p>

                    <p>They loved the glory that came from man more than they loved the glory that came from God.</p>

                    <p>Jesus cried out and said:</p>

                    <p>He who believes in me does not believe in me only, but also in the one who has sent me. I am come as light into the world so that whoever believes in me will not live in darkness.</p>

                    <p>If any man hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him, for I came not to judge the world but to save the world. The person who rejects me and does not receive my sayings, he has something that judges him. The word that I speak will judge him in the last day.</p>

                    <p>For I did not speak from myself; but the Father who sent me told me what to say and what to speak. I know that his commandment is life eternal. The words that I speak are the words he has told me to speak.</p>
