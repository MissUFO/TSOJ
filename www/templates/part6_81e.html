                    <h3>Healing the Demoniac Boy</h3>
                    <p>The next day, after coming down off the mountain, Jesus saw a multitude of people. He saw that the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scribes')">scribes</a> were questioning his <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">12 disciples</a>.</p>

                    <p>When the crowd saw Jesus, they were amazed because Jesus' face was shining.</p>

                    <p>Jesus asked the multitude and his disciples what questions were asked by the scribes.</p>

                    <p>One of the men in the crowd knelt before Jesus and said:</p>

                    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('teacher')">Teacher</a>, I have brought my son, who has an evil spirit that keeps him from talking; he also has epilepsy and is suffering greatly. The <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('demon')">evil spirit</a> throws him down, and he gnashes his teeth and he foams at the mouth.</p>

                    <p>He is badly bruised from all the abuse and is full of sores. I brought the boy to your disciples but they could not cast out the evil spirit.</p>

                    <p>Jesus told the man:</p>

                    <p>Oh faithless and perverse generation, how long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring your son to me.</p>

                    <p>They brought the boy to Jesus and when the boy saw Jesus, the demon threw him to the ground and he began thrashing about and foaming at the mouth.</p>

                    <p>Jesus asked the father:</p>

                    <p>How long has your son been like this?</p>

                    <p>The father replied:</p>

                    <p>Since he was a young child. Sometimes the unclean spirit throws him into the fire and sometimes he throws him into water.</p>

                    <p>If you can do anything for him, please have compassion on us and help us.</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>If I can! All things are possible to the one who believes.</p>

                    <p>Immediately the father of the child cried out to Jesus:</p>

                    <p>I believe, please help my unbelief!</p>

                    <p>When Jesus saw that people where running from everywhere to join the crowd,  he rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to him:</p>

                    <p>You deaf and dumb spirit, I command you to come out of him and do not enter him again.</p>

                    <p>The unclean spirit caused a great deal of torment as he obstinately came out of the boy, and the boy lay still on the ground as if he were dead.</p>

                    <p>Jesus took the boy by the hand, pulled him up, and he was healed.  Jesus gave the boy to his father.</p>

                    <p>All  were astonished at the majesty of God.</p>

                    <p>Afterwards, Jesus went to the house where he was staying. His disciples came to him and asked him:</p>

                    <p>How come we could not cast out the unclean spirit? </p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>Because of your little faith. Listen to this truth and pay attention, for if you had faith as a grain of mustard seed you will say to this mountain, move to another place and it will move.</p>

                    <p>If you have faith, nothing will be impossible for you.</p>

                    <p>Then he said to them:</p>

                    <p>This kind of demon can only come out with prayer.</p>
