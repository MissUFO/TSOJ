                    <h1>Jesus Teaches About Divorce</h1>

                    <p>After Jesus had finished this teaching, he left from <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('galilee')">Galilee</a>. He came to the borders of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('judea')">Judea</a> and beyond the Jordan River.</p>

                    <p>And the multitudes gathered together around him and he taught them and healed them.</p>

                    <p>And <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> came to Jesus and asked him if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason.</p>

                    <p>The were testing him to try and find fault with his answer.</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered them by asking:</p>

                    <p>What did <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('lawsofmoses')">Moses</a> command you?</p>

                    <p>They replied:</p>

                    <p>Moses required that he write a certificate of divorce and send her away.</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>Have you not read that God made them male and female from the beginning?</p>

                    <img src="img/davidtowermoon.png" class="img-responsive" name="davidtowermoon" title="davidtowermoon" />
                    <p>And for this reason a man will leave his own father and mother and join himself to his wife, and the two will become one. They are no longer two, but one flesh.</p>

                    <p>What God has joined together let no man break apart.</p>

                    <p>They answered Jesus:</p>

                    <p>Then why did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce, and send her away?</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, wrote you this commandment and tolerated you putting away your wives.</p>

                    <p>But that is not the way it was supposed to be. From the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.</p>

                    <p>Later on the disciples of Jesus came to him and asked him to explain the matter of marriage and divorce.</p>

                    <p>Jesus told them:</p>

                    <p>Whoever puts his wife away, except for sexual immorality, and marries another women, commits adultery against her.</p>

                    <p>His disciples said to him:</p>

                    <p>If that is the way it is then it is not a good idea to marry?</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>I am going to tell you something that is not for everyone, but for only for those who can receive it.</p>

                    <p>There are eunuchs who were born that way, and those who have been made eunuchs by the violence of men.</p>

                    <p>But there are also eunuchs who have made themselves <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('eunuch')">eunuch</a> for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                    <p>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</p>
