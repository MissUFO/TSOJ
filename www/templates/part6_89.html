                    <h1>The Feast of Tabernacles</h1>
                    <p>The Jews from <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('jerusalem')">Jerusalem</a> who were at the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('feast')">Feast of the Tabernacles</a> kept looking for Jesus. They asked:</p>

                    <p>Where is he?</p>

                    <p>There was a lot of murmuring and rumors among the multitudes about Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Some said:</p>

                    <p>He is a good man.</p>	

                    <p>Others said:</p>

                    <p>No, he leads the people astray.</p>

                    <p>But no one spoke openly about Jesus for fear of the Jews of Jerusalem.</p>

                    <p>During the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('temple')">temple</a> and taught. The Jews from Jerusalem were amazed:</p>

                    <p>How is this man so learned and wise since he has had no formal education?</p>

                    <p>Jesus told them:</p>

                    <img src="img/jesusjudea.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="jesusjudea" title="jesusjudea" />
                    <p>The teaching is not mine, it comes from the one who sent me.</p>

                    <p>The person who speaks for himself is looking for his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him, is a man of truth and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>

                    <p>Didn't <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('lawsofmoses')">Moses give you the law</a>, and yet none of you keep the law? Why do you want to kill me?</p>

                    <p>The multitude answered:</p>

                    <p>You have a <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('demon')">demon</a>. Who is trying to kill you?</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>I did one work and you all marvel because of it. Moses gave you <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('circumcise')">circumcision</a>, and you circumcise a man on the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('sabbath')">Sabbath</a>.</p>

                    <p>If a man is circumcised on the Sabbath so the law of Moses is not broken, then why are you infuriated with me for making a man completely whole on the Sabbath?</p>

                    <p>Stop judging things by their appearance, but judge by what is right.</p>

                    <img src="img/jeruarches.png" class="img-responsive" name="jeruarches" title="jeruarches" />
                    <p>Some of the people in Jerusalem said:</p>

                    <p>Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? Look, he speaks openly and they don't say anything to him. Could it be that the rulers know that he is the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('christ')">Christ</a>?</p>

                    <p> How is it that we know where this man comes from? But when the Christ comes, no one will know where he came from.</p>

                    <p>Jesus, in the temple, said:</p>

                    <p>You know me and you know where I came from. I have not come of myself but the one who sent me is true, and you do not know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.</p>

                    <p>They tried to capture Jesus, but no one could lay a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.</p>

                    <p>Many in the multitude believed in Jesus, and they said:</p>

                    <p>When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?</p>

                    <p>The <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> heard what the crowds were saying about Jesus, and they sent the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('officerspharisees')">officers</a> to capture him.</p>

                    <p>Jesus knew that his time was short and said:</p>

                    <p>I am only going to be with you a little while longer, and then I will go to the one who sent me. You will look for me, but you will not find me. Where I am going you cannot come.</p>

                    <img src="img/cottongate.png" class="img-responsive" name="cottongate" title="cottongate" />
                    <p>The Jews from Jerusalem said to themselves:</p>

                    <p>Where will this man go that we cannot find him? Will he go to the be with the Jews who live among the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('greek')">Greeks</a>, and teach the Greeks?</p>

                    <p>What does he mean when he says, You will look for me but you will not find me; and where I am going you cannot come.</p>

                    <p>Now on the last day of the great feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying:</p>

                    <p>If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. The person who believes in me, as the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">Scriptures</a> say, from within him will flow rivers of living water.</p>

                    <p>Jesus spoke these things of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('holyspirit')">Holy Spirit</a>, which those who believe in him were going to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>

                    <p>Some of the multitude, when they heard Jesus, said:</p>

                    <p>This is truly a prophet.</p>

                    <p>Others said:</p>

                    <p>This is the Christ.</p>

                    <img src="img/romesidenav.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="romesidenav" title="romesidenav" />
                    <p>But some said:</p>

                    <p>What, does the Christ come from Galilee? Doesn't the Scripture say that the Christ is going to come from the seed of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('david')">David</a> and from <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('bethlehem')">Bethlehem</a>, the village where David lived?</p>

                    <p>So there was a division among the people because of Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Some wanted to arrest him; but no man laid a finger on him.</p>

                    <p>When the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('officerspharisees')">officers</a> sent to arrest Jesus returned empty handed, the chief priests and the Pharisees asked them why.</p>

                    <p>The officers said:</p>

                    <p>We have never heard a man speak like this man.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> answered them and said:</p>

                    <p>Have you also been led astray? Have any of the rulers believed in him?</p>

                    <p>Have any of the Pharisees believed in him? The crowd is ignorant of the law and under a curse.</p>

                    <p>Nicodemus (the ruler who came to Jesus by night) said to them:</p>

                    <p>Does our law judge a man before it hears the case and learns the facts?</p>

                    <p>They answered Nicodemus:</p>

                    <p>Are you also from Galilee? Search the Scriptures and you will find that no prophet arises out of Galilee.</p>
