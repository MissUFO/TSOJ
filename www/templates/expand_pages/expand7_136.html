        <h3>136. EXAMINATION BY ANNAS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">FRIDAY BEFORE DAWN.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 18: 12-14, 19-23.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> So the band and the chief captain, and the officers 
            of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> and led him to Annas 
            first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 
            (<span class="comm">For confusion in the priesthood, etc., see pp. 64 and 528.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> Now Caiaphas 
            was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should 
            die for the people. (<span class="comm">See p. 528. John restates this fact to remind the 
                reader that Jesus was about to be tried by those who had prejudged him and 
                decided upon his death.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his 
            disciples, and of his teaching. (<span class="comm">We should note that John calls Annas high 
                priest. The high priesthood was a life office. According to Moses, Annas was 
                high priest, but the Romans had given the office to Caiaphas, so that Annas was 
                high priest de jure, but Caiaphas was so de facto. As high 
                priest, therefore, and as head of the Sadducean party, the people looked to 
                Annas before Caiaphas, taking Jesus to him first. The influence of Annas is 
                shown by the fact that he made five of his son and sons-in-law high priests. 
                Annas is said to have been about sixty years old at this time. He questioned 
                Jesus for the purpose of obtaining, if possible, some material out of which to 
                frame an accusation.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the 
            world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come 
            together; and in secret spake I nothing.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> Why askest thou me? 
            Ask them that have heard me, 
            what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said. (<span class="comm">Jesus 
                indeed spoke some things privately (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 13: 10-11</span></span>), but he did not do so for 

                the purposes of 
                concealment (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10: 27</span></span>). Jesus was 
                the light of the world; addressing his teachings to all flesh, he chose the 
                most public places to utter them--places, however, dedicated to the 
                worship of the true God. He who had said that heaven and earth would pass away, 
                but that his word would not pass away, did not suffer his teaching to be held 
                in contempt; he did not permit it to be made matter for cross examination. On 
                the contrary, it was to be taken cognizance of among the things universally 
                known and understood. The very officers who had arrested him could tell about 
                it--<span class="style7">John 7: 45-46</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And 
            when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his 
            hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> Jesus answered 
            him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest 
            thou me? (<span class="comm">Jesus was then under arrest, and as the trial had not yet opened 
                there was ample time to add new matter to the charges against him. If, in 
                addressing the high priest, he had just spoken words worthy of punishment, the 
                officer who struck him should, instead, have preferred charges against him and 
                had him punished in a legal manner. If the officer could not do this (<span class="comm">and the 
                    point is that he could not</span>), he was doubly wrong in striking him. Thus the Lord 
                calmly rebuked the wrong-doer. Compare his conduct with that of Paul under 
                somewhat similar circumstances (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 23: 1-3</span></span>). Jesus exemplified his teaching at <span class="style7">Matthew 5: 39</span>. "Christ," says Luther, "forbids 
                self-defense with the hand, not with the tongue."</span>)
