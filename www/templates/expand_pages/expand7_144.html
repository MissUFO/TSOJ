        <h3>144A. THE CRUCIFIXION. ON THE WAY TO THE CROSS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">WITHIN AND WITHOUT JERUSALEM. FRIDAY MORNING.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 27: 31-34;  MARK 15: 20-23; <br>LUKE 23: 26-33;  JOHN 19: 17</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 31</span>  And when they had mocked him, they took off from 
            him the  purple,  robe, and put 
            on him his garments (<span class="comm">This ended the mockery, which seems to have been begun 
                in a state of levity, but which ended in gross indecency and violence. When we 
                think of him who endured it all, we can not contemplate the scene without a 
                shudder. Who can measure the grace of God or the depravity of man?</span>),</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 17</span> They took Jesus therefore:  
            And they lead him out to crucify him.  and led 
            him away to crucify him.  and he went 
            out, bearing the cross for himself, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 32</span> And as they came out,  
            when they led him away,  they found a man of Cyrene, 
            Simon by name:  one passing by, coming from the 
            country, the father of Alexander and Rufus,  him 
            they  laid hold upon {
            compel  compelled} to go 
            with them, that he might bear his cross.  
            and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus. (<span class="comm">Cyrene was a 
                flourishing city in the north of Africa, having in it a large Jewish 
                population, and Simon shows by his name that he was a Jew. The Cyreneans had 
                one or more synagogues in Jerusalem (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 2: 10; 6: 9; 11: 20</span></span>). There were many Cyreneans afterwards engaged in 
                spreading the gospel (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 13: 1</span></span>), and 
                since the sons of this man are spoken of as well known to Mark's readers it is 
                altogether likely that Simon was one of them. This Rufus may be the one 
                mentioned by Paul (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 16: 13</span></span>). The 
                Roman soldiers found Simon entering the city, and because he was a stranger and 
                they needed a man just then, they impressed him after the manner mentioned on 
                p. 245.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 27</span> And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of 
            women who bewailed and lamented him. (<span class="comm">Only the women bewailed him. They 
                were not Galil&aelig;ans, but women of Jerusalem.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> But Jesus turning unto 
            them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, 
            and for your children. (<span class="comm">Some of these women, and the children of others, 
                would survive till the terrible siege of Jerusalem and suffer in it. Jesus bore 
                his own suffering in silence, but his pity for those upon whom these days of 
                anguish would come caused him to speak.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> For behold, the days are coming, 
            in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, 
            and the breasts that never gave suck. (<span class="comm">The proper blessedness of a matron 
                is motherhood, but the horrors of the siege would reverse even so fixed a law 
                as this.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and 
            to the hills, Cover us. (<span class="comm">This language is figurative, describing one in 
                extreme terror seeking impossible 

                refuge. But there is a touch of 
                literalness in the fulfillment, for Josephus tells us that at the end of the 
                siege those in Jerusalem hid themselves in the subterranean recesses of the 
                city, and that no less than two thousand of them were buried alive under the 
                ruins of these hiding-places Wars 6: 9. 4.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> For if they do these 
            things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry? (<span class="comm">The language here 
                is obscurely proverbial. Here, as elsewhere (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 19: 43; Matthew 24: 15</span></span>), Jesus refers to the sorrows which the 
                Romans were to bring upon the Jews, and the meaning may be, If the fiery 
                persecution of Rome is so consuming that my innocence, though again and again 
                pronounced by the governor himself, is no protection against it, what will that 
                fire do when it envelopes the dry, guilty, rebellious city of Jerusalem? Or we 
                may make the present and the future grief of the women the point of comparison, 
                and interpret thus: If they cause such sorrow to the women while the city is 
                like a green tree, how much more when, like a dry, dead tree, it is about to 
                fall.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span>  And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be 
            put to death.  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 22</span> And they 
            bring him unto the place  which is called in Hebrew, 
            Golgotha:  which is, being interpreted, {that is to say,} The place of a skull (<span class="comm">Where this place was, 
                or why it was so called, are matters of conjecture. All that we know certainly 
                is that it was outside of, yet near, the city <span class="style7">Hebrews 13: 12; John 19: 20</span></span>),  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 33</span> And when they came unto the place which is called The skull,</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> they gave {
            offered} him wine  to drink mingled with gall: 
            {myrrh:} but {and} when he 
            had tasted it, he would not drink.  he received it 
            not. (<span class="comm">This mixture of sour wine mingled with gall and myrrh was intended to 
                dull the sense of pain of those being crucified or otherwise severely punished. 
                The custom is said to have originated with the Jews and not with the Romans. 
                Jesus declined it because it was the Father's will that he should suffer. He 
                would not go upon the cross in a drugged, semi-conscious condition.</span>)
