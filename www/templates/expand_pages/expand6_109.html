        <h3>109. JESUS TEACHES ABOUT DIVORCE.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 19: 1-12; MARK 10: 1-12.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 19: 1</span> And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these 
            words (<span class="comm">the words contained in <span class="style7">
                    Matthew 18</span>, which are the last teachings in Galilee recorded by any of 
                the Evangelists, p. 435 and p. 439 he departed from Galilee (<span class="comm">Having come 
                    into the borders of it again from Ephraim. It seems likely that 

                    Matthew takes in at one view both departures from Galilee, viz.: that mentioned 
                    on p. 441 and that at Section 95, for Matthew records none 
                    of the intervening events and Jesus spent no time in Galilee between the two 
                    journeys, merely returning to the border of the land and making a second 
                    journey thence to Jerusalem. He now left Galilee to return thither no more 
                    until after the resurrection--<span class="style7">Matthew 28: 16, 17; John 21: 1</span></span>),  


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 10: 1</span> And he 
                    arose from thence, and cometh {came}into the borders of Jud&aelig;a and beyond the Jordan (<span class="comm">The 
                        land beyond the Jordan was called Per&aelig;a. See p. 176. It was no part of 
                        Jud&aelig;a, but belonged to the tetrarchy of Herod. It and the river Jordan 
                        bordered Jud&aelig;a on the east</span>):  


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 19: 2</span> and 
                    multitudes  come together unto him again;followed him;  and, as he was wont, he 
                    taught them again. (<span class="comm">The teachings of this journey will be found in Sections 
                        109-112.</span>)   and he healed them there. (<span class="comm">No doubt bands 
                        of pilgrims on their way to the Passover helped to swell the multitudes which 
                        now surrounded the Lord.</span>)   


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 10: 2</span>  And there came unto 
                    him Pharisees, and asked him,  saying,Is it lawful for a man  to put away his 
                    wife for every cause? (<span class="comm">I.e., for every cause satisfactory to the 
                        husband.</span>)   trying him. (<span class="comm">Knowing that Jesus had 
                        modified the law of Moses, the Pharisees asked this question, seeking to entrap 
                        him. If he had reaffirmed his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 5: 32</span></span>), they hoped to make it appear that he 
                        despised the authority of Moses. But if he ratified the law of Moses, then they 
                        would show that he was contradicting his former teaching, and hence too 
                        inconsistent to be worthy of credit. For the Lord's teaching concerning divorce 
                        see p. 242.</span>) 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command 
                    you? 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of 
                    divorcement, and to put her away.  


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 19: 4</span> And 
                    he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and 
                    female, 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> and said, For this cause shall a man leave 
                    his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one 
                    flesh? 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> So 

                    that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, 
                    let not man put asunder. (<span class="comm">Jesus went back to the original law propounded by 
                        God and recorded by Moses, and shows from it: 1. That marriage is a fundamental 
                        principle of social order, God having it in view from the creation, and hence 
                        making them male and female. 2. That the relation of marriage is superior even 
                        to the parental relation. 3. That by it the pair become one flesh, so that a 
                        man is as much joined to his wife as he is to his own body. Now, since a man 
                        can only be separated from his parental relations or from his own body by 
                        death, which is an act of God, so it follows that the superior or similar 
                        relation of marriage can only be dissolved by the act of God. Thus Jesus draws 
                        the conclusion that no man or body of men, whether acting in private, civil, or 
                        ecclesiastical capacity, can dissolve marriage otherwise than according to the 
                        decrees of God.</span>)


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give a 
                    writing of divorcement, and to put her
                    away? (<span class="comm">Seeing that Jesus reaffirmed his former teaching, the 
                        Jews proceed to show that he is in conflict with the law of Moses, apparently 
                        failing to note that Jesus has merely cited Scripture, and that therefore the 
                        issue is really Moses against Moses.</span>)   


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 10: 5</span> But Jesus 
                    said {saith} unto them, Moses for your hardness of 
                    heart  wrote you this commandment.  
                    suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not 
                    been so.  


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> But from the beginning of the 
                    creation, Male and female made he them. (<span class="comm">Thus Jesus replies that Moses did 
                        not command but suffered or permitted (<span class="comm">the word 
                            "commandment" used by Mark having reference not to the matter but 
                            the manner; i. e., commanding it to be done by giving a writing</span>) men to 
                        put away their wives because at the time when the law was given the wickedness 
                        of men made such a concession beneficial. Had the law propounded at creation 
                        been re-enacted by Moses, many would have refused to marry at all, preferring 
                        an illicit life to the hazard of matrimony under a stringent law, and others 
                        finding themselves unhappily married would have secretly murdered their wives 
                        to gain their 

                        liberty. As a choice of two evils, God therefore 
                        temporarily modified the law out of compassion for women. It was expected that 
                        as the hearts of men softened they would recognize the wisdom, justice and 
                        wholesomeness of the original law, and cease to take advantage of their 
                        permission to evade it. But men had not done this, and Christ himself had 
                        brought this concession to an end, and since then it has been the most daring 
                        interference with the divine prerogative, for men to venture on a continuance 
                        of the same concession, as though they were possessed of divine authority.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> And in the house his disciples asked him again of this matter. 

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And he saith unto them,  


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 19: 9</span> And I say 
                    unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall 
                    marry another, committeth adultery:  against her;
                    and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth 
                    adultery.  


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 10: 12</span> and if she herself shall 
                    put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery. (<span class="comm">Thus 
                        Jesus reaffirms the teaching at <span class="style7">Matthew 5: 32</span>.</span>)   


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 19: 10</span> The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. (<span class="comm">The 
                        disciples illustrate not only the hardness of heart of which Jesus spoke, but 
                        also the wisdom of allowing divorce under the law of Moses.</span>) 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> But he said 
                    unto them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is 
                    given. 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> For there are eunuchs, that were so born from their 
                    mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs of men: and there 
                    are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He 
                    that is able to receive it, let him receive it. (<span class="comm">"This saying" 
                        is the saying which Jesus himself had just uttered concerning divorce: and his 
                        teaching is that the prohibition of divorce does not apply to eunuchs. If a 
                        woman finds herself married to a eunuch, she is not bound to him. So with a man 
                        married to a hermaphrodite.
