        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT CAPERNAUM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 8: 14-17;  MARK 1: 29-34;  LUKE 4: 38-41.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 38</span>     And he arose out of the synagogue (<span class="comm">where he had 
                just healed the demoniac</span>),  
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 29</span>    And 
            straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came {entered}  into the house of Simon and 
            Andrew, with James and John. (<span class="comm">Peter and Andrew had dwelt at Bethsaida 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 44</span></span>). They may have removed to 
                Capernaum, or Bethsaida, being near by, may be here counted as a part, or 
                suburb, of Capernaum. Its name does not contradict this view, for it means 
                "house of fishing" or "fishery."</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span>   Now Simon's 
            wife's mother lay sick of {was holden with} a great 
            fever. (<span class="comm">The Papists, who claim that Peter was the first pope, must confess 
                that he was married at this time, and continued to be so for years afterwards 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 9: 5</span></span>). Celibacy is 
                unauthorized by Scripture (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 13: 4</span></span>). God says it is not good (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 2: 18
                    </span></span>). Luke speaks as a physician; for Galen, the father of medicine, divided 
                fevers into little and great.</span>)    </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 14</span>    And when Jesus 
            was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever.
            and straightway they tell him of her:  
            and they besought him for her. (<span class="comm">Their interest in her shows the 
                spirit of love and kindness which pervaded the home.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 31</span>   and he came  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 39</span>    And he stood over 
            her, and rebuked the fever (<span class="comm">Though it was an inanimate force, it was still 
                subject to rebuke, as were the winds and waves of Galilee--<span class="style7">Matthew 8: 26</span></span>);  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 15</span>   And he touched her hand,  and took her by the 
            hand, and raised her up (<span class="comm">thus showing the miracle came from him, and that 
                he felt a tender interest in the sufferer</span>);  and it 
            {the fever}  left her: and 
            immediately she rose up {arose,}  
            and she ministered unto them. {him.} (<span class="comm">Her 
                complete recovery emphasized the miracle. Such fevers invariably leave the 
                patient weak, 

                and the period of convalescence is long and trying, 
                and often full of danger. She showed her gratitude by her ministry.</span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 32</span>   And at even,  when even was 
            come,  when the sun was setting, {did set,}  all they that had any sick with 
            divers diseases, brought them unto him;  they brought 
            unto him all that were sick, and them {many}
            that were possessed with demons. (<span class="comm">Their delay till 
                sundown was unquestionably caused by the traditional law of the Sabbath which 
                forbade men to carry any burden on that day (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 10</span></span>). The Sabbath closed at sundown (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 23: 32</span></span>). The distinction is drawn between the sick and the 
                demon-possessed. Lightfoot gives two reasons why demoniacal possession was so 
                common at that time, viz.: 1, the intense wickedness of the nation; 2, the 
                addiction of the nation to magic, whereby the people invited evil spirits to be 
                familiar with them.</span>)   and he laid his hands on every one 
            of them,  and he cast out the spirits with a word, and 
            healed all  them  that were 
            sick: 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 17</span>    that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through 
            Isaiah the prophet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 53: 4</span></span>), saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our diseases. 
            (<span class="comm">Isaiah's vision is progressive; he sees, first, a man of sorrows; second, a 
                man sorrowful because he bore the sickness and sorrows of others; third, a man 
                who also bore sin, and healed the souls of others by so doing. Such was the 
                order of Christ's life. His early years were spent in poverty and obscurity; 
                his days of ministry in bearing, by sympathy and compassion, the sicknesses and 
                sorrows of others (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 11: 35; Mark 14: 34</span></span>); and in the hour of his crucifixion, he became the world's 
                sin-bearer--<span class="style7">John 1: 29; 1 Peter 2: 24.</span></span>)   
        </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 33</span>   And all the city was gathered 
            together at the door.  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span>    And he healed many that were sick of 
            divers diseases, and cast out many demons;   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 41</span>    And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the 
            Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them {the 
            demons}  not to speak,  because 
            they knew him.  that he was Christ. (<span class="comm">Those who are 
                disposed to frequent spiritual seances and to seek information from mediums 
                should remember that the Son of God permitted his disciples to receive no 
                information from such sources. He forbade demons to speak in the presence of 
                his own, even on the most important of all topics.</span>) </p>
