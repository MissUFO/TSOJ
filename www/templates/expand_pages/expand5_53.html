        <h3>53. TWO BUILDERS.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 7: 24-29;  LUKE 6: 46-49.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 46</span> And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? (<span class="comm">Why do ye give me the title, but withhold the service which should go with it?--<span class="style7">
                    Malachi 1: 6.</span></span>)   

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 7: 24</span> Every one therefore that cometh unto me, and heareth my words {these words of mine,} and doeth them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">
                    John 13: 17; James 1: 22</span></span>),  I will show you whom 
            he is like: 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 48</span> he is like {shall be 
            likened unto}  a man building a house, who digged and 
            went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock:  a wise 
            man who built his house upon the rock (<span class="comm">The word "rock" suggests 
                Christ himself. No life can be founded upon Christ's teaching unless it be 
                founded also upon faith and trust in his personality. For this we must dig 
                deep, for as St. Gregory says, "God is not to be found on the 
                surface"</span>): 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 7: 25</span> and the rain descended, and the floods came, and 
            the winds blew, and beat upon that house;  and when a 
            flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it:
            and it fell not:  because it had 
            been well builded.  for it was founded upon the 
            rock. (<span class="comm">The imagery of this passage would be impressive anywhere, but is 
                especially so when used before an audience accustomed to the fierceness of an 
                Eastern tempest. Rains, floods, etc., represent collectively the trials, the 
                temptations and persecutions which come upon us from without. There comes a 
                time to every life when these things throng together and test the resources of 
                our strength.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> And every one {<span class="style5">Luke 6: 
                49</span> But he} that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not shall be likened unto {is like}a foolish man, who {that} built a { his} house upon the sand: {earth} without a foundation; 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> and the 
            rain 

            descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, 
            and smote upon that house; {against which the stream 
            brake,} and straightway it fell in;  and great was the 
            fall thereof.  and the ruin of that house was great.
            (<span class="comm">We do not need to go to Palestine to witness the picture portrayed here. 
                Whole towns on the Missouri and the lower Mississippi have been undermined and 
                swept away because built upon the sand. Jesus here limits the tragedy to a 
                single house. "A single soul is a great ruin in the eyes of God" 
                (<span class="comm">Godet</span>). Jesus did not end his sermon with a strain of consolation. It 
                is not always best to do so.</span>)   

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> And it came to 
            pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at 
            his teaching: 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> for he taught them as 
            one having authority, and not as their scribes. (<span class="comm">See 
                page 166.</span>)
