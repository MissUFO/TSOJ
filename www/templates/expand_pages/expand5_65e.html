        <h3>65E. FIRST PARABLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">BESIDE THE SEA OF GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>PARABLES OF THE MUSTARD SEED.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 13: 31-35;  MARK 4: 30-34.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13:31</span> Another parable set he before them, saying,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 30</span> And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom 
            of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth? (<span class="comm">These questions are 
                intended to emphasize the superior excellence of the kingdom.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> It
            The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, 
            which a man took, and sowed in his field:  a grain of 
            mustard seed, which, 

            when it is sown upon the earth, 
            though  indeed  
            it be {is}  less than all the 
            seeds that are upon the earth (<span class="comm">that is, the smallest of all the seeds that 
                are sown in a garden</span>),  but

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> yet when it is sown, groweth up, and  
            when it is grown, it is {becometh} greater 
            than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches;  
            and becometh a tree (<span class="comm">in Palestine it attains the height of ten feet</span>),
            so that the birds of the heaven come and  can lodge 
            under the shadow thereof.  in the branches thereof. 
            (<span class="comm">This parable sets forth the smallness of the beginning of the kingdom, and the 
                magnitude of its growth.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom 
            of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of 
            meal, till it was all leavened. (<span class="comm">In Oriental housekeeping, yeast is not 
                preserved in a separate form. A piece of leavened dough saved over from the 
                last baking is added to the new dough to ferment it. Three measures contained 
                the quantity usually taken for one baking. Leaven represents the quickness, 
                quietness, thoroughness, and sureness with which gospel truth diffuses itself 
                through human society. A woman is named because baking was part of her 
                household duty.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the 
            multitudes;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 33</span> And with many such 
            parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it (<span class="comm">that 
                is, as they had leisure or opportunity to listen</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> and without a 
            parable spake he not {nothing} unto them (<span class="comm">that 
                is, he used nothing but parables on that occasion, for both before and after 
                this he taught without parables</span>):

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> that it might be fulfilled which 
            was spoken through the prophet (<span class="comm">at <span class="style7">Psalm 78: 2</span> which is usually attributed to Asaph, who is called a seer 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Chronicles 29: 30</span></span>). His teaching 
                typified that of Christ</span>), saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I 
            will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world. (<span class="comm">Jesus fulfilled 
                this prophecy in a notable manner, being the only teacher in history 
                distinguished in any marked degree by the use of parables.</span>)   
            but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.
