        <h3>80. FOUR THOUSAND FED.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 15: 30-39;  MARK 7: 32-8: 9.</h3>
        <h3><span class="style5">MATTHEW 14: 13;  MARK 6: 30-32;  LUKE 9: 10;  JOHN 6: 1.</span></h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 7: 32</span> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech (<span class="comm">The man had evidently learned to speak before he lost his hearing. Some think that defective hearing had caused the impediment in his speech, but <span class="style7">Matthew 15: 35 </span>suggests that he was tongue-tied</span>); and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue (<span class="comm">He separated him from the crowd to avoid publicity (<span class="comm">see <span class="style7">Matthew 15: 36</span>, below</span>), and by signs indicating an intention to heal, Jesus gives him the assurance which in other cases he is accustomed to give by words. He evidently induced the man by signs to stick out his tongue. He then placed one finger of each hand in the man's ears, after which he spat. Where he spit is not said. He then touched with one or both his thumbs the man's tongue, and, speaking the healing word, the cure was accomplished</span>);        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. (<span class="comm">Jesus here, as in the healing of Jairus' daughter, spoke the Aramaic. Why he sighed is not said. It was doubtless an expression of sympathy, though Farrar thinks he did so because he thought of the millions there were of deaf and dumb who in this world never hear and never speak.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. (<span class="comm">He was evidently not deaf from his birth, or he would not have known how to speak at all.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it. (<span class="comm">Jesus was still seeking to suppress excitement. A very little encouragement from him would have brought together a multitude, the very thing which he was journeying to avoid. He therefore cautioned the people to be silent, but by a common freak of human nature, his desire to avoid publicity made him more wonderful in the eyes of the people, and thereby inspired a greater eagerness on their part to tell about him.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And they were beyond measure astonished (<span class="comm">Mark here coins a double superlative to express the boundlessness of their amazement</span>), saying, He hath done all things well (<span class="comm">commendation upon the workman which had originally been bestowed upon his work--<span class="style7">Genesis 1: 31</span></span>); he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. (<span class="comm">These were the people who had asked Jesus to depart from their coast on account of the loss of their swine. A complete change in their feelings had taken place since that day.</span>)  

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 15: 30</span> And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them (<span class="comm">We have here an instance of the common difference between the narratives of Matthew and Mark. Where Matthew is wont to mention the healing of multitudes, Mark picks out one of the most remarkable cases and describes it minutely. The hasty action of those who brought in the sick and returned to bring in others is indicated by the way in which they cast down their burdens at Jesus' feet</span>):

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel (<span class="comm">The people whom Jesus healed were Jews, but daily intercourse with the heathen of Decapolis had tended to cool their religious ardor. The works of Jesus revived this ardor and caused them to praise the God whose prophet they esteemed Jesus to be.</span>)


        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> And
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 1</span> In those days (<span class="comm">i. e., while Christ was in Decapolis</span>), when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, {saith,} unto them,        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> I have compassion on the 
            multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to 
            eat:  And I would not send them away fasting, lest 
            haply they faint on the way.  
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way: for some of them are come from far. (<span class="comm">When the five thousand had been caught in similar circumstances, the apostles had come with suggestions to Jesus, but now, being taught by experience, they keep silence and let Jesus manage as he will. The multitude had not been three days without food, but it had been with Jesus three days and was now without food.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> And his {the} disciples say unto {answered} him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place? Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude? (<span class="comm">It seems strange that the apostles should ask such a question after having assisted in feeding the five thousand. But the failure to expect a miracle, despite previous experience, was a common occurrence in the history of Israel and of the twelve (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 11: 21-23; Psalm 78: 19, 20</span></span>). In this case 
                the failure of the apostles to expect miraculous relief suggests that they had 
                probably often been hungry and had long since ceased to look for supernatural 
                relief in such cases. Their disbelief here is so similar to their disbelief in 
                the first instance that it, with a few other minor details, has led 
                rationalistic commentators to confound the miracle with the feeding of the five 
                thousand. But the words of Jesus forbid this--<span class="style7">Matthew 16: 9, 10; Mark 8: 19, 20</span>.</span>)</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 15: 34</span> And Jesus said unto them,</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 5</span> And he asked them, How many 
            loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.  and a few small 
            fishes. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 15: 35</span> And he commanded {commandeth} the multitude to sit down on the ground (<span class="comm">they were on the bleak mountain, and not in the grassy plain of Butaiha</span>): and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his {the} disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. {to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.}        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 7</span> And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them. 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 15: 37</span> And they all ate, 
            and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken 
            pieces, seven baskets full. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> And they that did eat 
            were  about  four thousand men, 
            besides women and children. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> And he sent away the multitudes.
        </p>
