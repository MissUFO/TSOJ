        <h3>131. THE LORD'S SUPPER INSTITUTED.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM. EVENING BEFORE THE CRUCIFIXION.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 26: 26-29;  MARK 14: 22-25; LUKE 22: 19-20;<br>1 CORINTHIANS 11: 23-26.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 26</span> And as they were eating,
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">I Corinthians 11:23</span> the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took 
            bread;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> and when he had given thanks, {
            blessed,}  he brake it,  and

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 26</span> he 

            gave to the disciples, and said,  
            Take ye:  Take, eat; this is my body.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">I Corinthians 11: 24</span> which is  given  
            for you: this do in remembrance of me. (<span class="comm">As only unleavened bread was eaten 
                during the paschal supper, that kind of bread must have been used by our Lord, 
                and it is fitting that it should still be used by us in keeping the Lord's 
                Supper, not only for propriety's sake, but because that bread which is 
                emblematic of purity is most suitable to represent the body of the sinless 
                Christ. The Catholics and some few others take our Lord's words literally when 
                he says, "This is my body." On this they found the doctrine of 
                transubstantiation, i. e., that the bread and the wine become literal 
                body and blood when blessed by the priest. There are many weighty arguments 
                against such a doctrine, but the main one for it is found in the 
                words of our Lord. But Jesus could not have meant them literally, for his body 
                was untouched and his blood unshed on this occasion when he spoke them. 
                Moreover, in the <span class="style7">Mark 14: 26</span> given below, Jesus calls the wine "the fruit of the 
                vine," when, according to the theory of transubstantiation, it had been 
                turned into blood and hence was not wine at all.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 23</span> And he took a {the} cup in like manner  also  after supper (<span class="comm">Luke 
                distinguishes between the cup taken during (<span class="comm">see p. 646</span>) and that taken after 
                supper. The first belonged to the passover, this to the Lord's Supper. Wine, 
                mingled with water, was drunk during the paschal supper. Jesus took a cup of 
                this for his new institution. But the word "wine" is nowhere used 
                in any of the accounts of the Lord's Supper, the terms "cup" and 
                "fruit of the vine" being employed in its stead. Those, therefore, 
                who choose to use unfermented grape juice are guilty of no irregularity.</span>) 
            and gave thanks, and  when he had 
            given thanks, he gave to them:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> And he said {saying}  unto them, <span class="style5">Matthew 26: 27</span> Drink ye all of it (<span class="comm">"All" refers to the persons and not to the 
                wine. It was important that all the disciples participate in the cup, but not 
                that all the wine should be used</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 28</span> for this is my blood of the 
            covenant,  This cup is the new covenant in my blood 
            (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jereremiah 31: 31-34</span>. It was the 
                practice of Eastern 

                peoples to use blood in making any pact or 
                covenant (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 24: 6-8</span></span>). Christ 
                represents himself as the victim from whence the blood was to be taken to 
                ratify or seal the new covenant, and he makes the cup the symbol of that blood. 
                A full discussion of the old and new covenants will be found in the Book of 
                Hebrews. We may, however, sum them up by saying that the old covenant promised 
                the land of Canaan and Christ in the flesh to the Israelites, while the new 
                covenant promises heaven and Christ in glory to the Christian</span>),which is poured out for many. (<span class="comm">It is explicitly stated 
                elsewhere that Christ died for all (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 2: 9; 2 Corinthians 5: 14-15</span></span>), and the word "many" is used, not 
                to contradict, but to emphasize the fact. When the persons included are 
                contemplated individually, the term many is employed on account of the 
                vast number of them; for no man can number the individuals for whom Christ 
                died. But when they are contemplated under the feebler conception of the whole, 
                the term all is employed.</span>)   unto remission of 
            sins.   even 
            that which is poured out for you. (<span class="comm">The prime object of Christ's death is 
                here declared. It was to accomplish the forgiveness of sins. All other purposes 
                which it served are subordinate to this, and all other blessings which it 
                secures are consequent upon this--<span class="style7">John 1: 29; Ephesians 5: 2; Hebrews 7: 27; 1 John 2: 2; 4: 10; Isaiah 53: 10; Romans 8: 2; 1 Corinthians 15: 3</span>.</span>)   this do, as often as ye drink
            it, in remembrance of me. (<span class="comm">The 
                word "remembrance" comes as a refrain after both the loaf and the 
                cup. The central purpose of the supper is to bring the sacrifice of Christ and 
                all its blessed results vividly to mind.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">I Corinthians 11: 26</span> For as often as ye eat this 
            bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come. (<span class="comm">This 
                verse is a comment of Paul's upon the nature of the supper. In keeping the 
                Lord's Supper we proclaim to our own souls and to the world our trust in the 
                death of Christ, and our hope that he will return and fulfill the expectations 
                begotten in us by it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 25</span> Verily I say unto you, {But <span class="style5">Matthew 26: 29</span>} I shall no more drink {shall not drink henceforth}  of the {
            this} fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it 
            new in  the kingdom of 

            God.
            my Father's kingdom.  and they all 
            drank of it. (<span class="comm">In speaking of this future drinking of the fruit of the vine 
                Jesus does not mean literal wine, for he does not drink literal wine with his 
                disciples in the kingdom as it now is, nor will he do so in the eternal 
                kingdom. The term "drink," therefore, is used figuratively for that 
                communion which Jesus has with his disciples while they are drinking the wine 
                of the Lord's Supper. The term new is most naturally understood as 
                modifying wine, but as the wine of the supper is not necessarily 
                new wine, we think it rather indicates the new method of drinking 
                wine just described.</span>)
