        <h3>83. TRIBUTE MONEY.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">CAPERNAUM, AUTUMN, A.D. 29</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 17: 24-27.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> And when they were come to Capernaum, they that 
            received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the 
            half-shekel? (<span class="comm">The law of Moses required from every male of twenty years and 
                upward the payment of a tax of half a shekel for the support of the temple 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 30: 12-16; 2 Chronicles 24: 5-6</span></span>). This tax was collected annually. We are told that a dispute 
                existed between the Pharisees and Sadducees as to whether the payment of this 
                tribute was voluntary or compulsory. The collectors of it may have thought that 
                Jesus regarded its payment as voluntary, or they may have thought that Jesus 
                considered himself exempt from it because he was so great a rabb1 Though this 
                temple tax was usually collected in March, Lightfoot informs us that the 
                payment of it was so irregular that its receivers kept two chests; in one of 
                which was placed the tax for the current year, and in the other that for the 
                year past. The demand was made upon Jesus at Capernaum because that was his 
                residence, and it was not made sooner because of the wandering life which he 
                led. It appears that since the first of April he had been in Capernaum only 
                once for a brief period, probably no longer than a Sabbath day (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 6: 22-24</span></span>). The Jewish shekel 
                answered to the Greek stater, which has been variously estimated as worth from 
                fifty to seventy-five cents. The stater contained four drachm&aelig;, and a 
                drachma was about equivalent to a Roman denarius, or seventeen cents.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> He 
            saith, Yea. (<span class="comm">Peter answered with his usual impulsive presumption. Probably 
                he had known the tribute to be paid before out of the general fund held by 
                Judas; or he may have assumed that Jesus 

                would fulfill this as one 
                of God's requirements.</span>) And when he came into the house, Jesus spake first 
            to him (<span class="comm">without waiting for him to tell what he had said</span>), 
            saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they 
            receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said unto him, Therefore the sons are 
            free. (<span class="comm">The argument is this: If the sons of kings are free from the payment 
                of tribute, I, the Son of God, am free from God's tribute. The half-shekel was 
                regarded as given to God--Jos. Ant. 18: 9. 1.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> But, lest 
            we cause them to stumble (<span class="comm">lest we be totally misunderstood, and be thought 
                to teach that men should not pay this tribute to God</span>), go thou to the 
            sea (<span class="comm">of Galilee</span>), and cast a hook, and take up the fish that 
            first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a shekel: 
            that take, and give unto them for me and thee. (<span class="comm">Jesus paid the tribute in 
                such a manner as to show that the whole realm of nature was tributary to him, 
                and that he was indeed the Son of the great King. Some have thought that our 
                Lord's beneficence, in paying Peter's tax also, was an evidence that Peter, 
                too, was exempt from tribute. But the conclusion is not well drawn. Had this 
                been intended, Jesus would have said "for us," and would not have 
                used the words "for me and thee," which distinguished between the 
                exempted Son and the unexempted subject. Though afterward Peter might possibly 
                have claimed exemption as a child of God by adoption, he was not yet free from 
                this duty to pay this tax--<span class="style7">John 1: 12</span>.</span>)
