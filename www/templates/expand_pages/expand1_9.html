        <h3>9. NAMING OF JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM, B.C. 4)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 2: 21 - 39. </h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span>     And when eight days (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 17: 12</span></span>) were fulfilled for circumcising him (<span class="comm">The rite was doubtless performed by Joseph. By this rite Jesus was &quot;made like unto his brethren&quot; (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Heb. 2: 16, 17</span></span>); that is, he became a member of the covenant nation, and became a debtor to the law--<span class="style7">GalatiAns 5: 3</span></span>)
            , his name was called JESUS (<span class="comm">see <span class="style7">Luke 1: 59</span></span>), which was so called by the angel before he was 
            conceived in the womb. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1: 31.</span></span>)   </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled (<span class="comm">Purification took place on the fortieth day after the nativity in the case of males, and eighty days in the case of females (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 12: 1 - 5</span></span>). Until it was performed the mother was not permitted to go to the temple, take part in any public service, or even to leave her house. It seems that the members of her family were also ceremonially unclean, because they came in daily contact with her</span>), they brought him up to Jerusalem (<span class="comm">to the temple</span>), to present him to the Lord (<span class="comm">When God slew the firstborn of Egypt he spared the firstborn of Israel. For this reason all the firstborn of Israel were regarded as being peculiarly the Lord's (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 12: 29, 30; 13: 2</span></span>); and the firstborn male child of each family had to be redeemed with money (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 13: 11 - 15; Numbers 18: 15, 16</span></span>). Originally the firstborn or eldest son was 
                priest of the household after his father's death; but God chose the Levites to 
                serve in his sanctuary in the place of these 

                firstborn or household 
                priests (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 3: 11 - 13; 8: 14 - 19</span></span>); but this choosing did not annul the statute which 
                required the payment of redemption money. The redemption money for a male was 
                five shekels of the sanctuary, or about $3.75--<span class="style7">Leviticus 27: 6</span></span>)  </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span>   (<span class="comm">as it is written in the law of the Lord 
                (<span class="comm">for additional passages see <span class="style7">Exodus 22: 29; 34: 
                        19, 20</span></span>), Every male that openeth the womb shall be called 
                holy to the Lord</span>),  
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span>     and to offer a sacrifice (<span class="comm">By redemption 
                money and sacrifice the life of Jesus was ceremonially redeemed from God the 
                Father, that his consecration of it to the will of the Father might be perfect. 
                We likewise are redeemed by the blood of Christ, but are expected nevertheless 
                to be more consecrated than ever</span>) according to that which is said in the law 
            of the Lord (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 12: 6 - 8; 5: 
                    11</span></span>), A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. (<span class="comm">The 
                required offering was a yearling lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon 
                for a sin-offering. But the law allowed a poor mother to substitute doves or 
                pigeons for the lamb. We see here an early trace of the poverty of Him who had 
                not where to lay his head. Knowing the greatness of the child, Joseph and Mary 
                would never have used the lesser sacrifice if they could have afforded the 
                regular and more costly one. Poverty is not dishonorable in God's sight; for 
                Mary was honored of him above all women.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span>     And behold, there was a man in 
            Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon (<span class="comm">the name means "Hearing." 
                Some think that it was Rabbi Simeon, the son of the great teacher Hillel; but 
                the context forbids such an idea</span>); and this man was righteous and 
            devout (<span class="comm">Right in outward and devout in his inward life. The first prophet 
                to tell the world that its Messiah had come was a thoroughly good man</span>), 
            looking for (<span class="comm">Waiting like Jacob (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 49:

                Prince, local, carnal, finite, temporal; we wait for a KING universal, 
                spiritual, infinite, eternal, the Son of God. Hence the magnitude of our 
                expected consolation is to theirs as an ocean is to a drop of 

                water</span>) the consolation of Israel (<span class="comm">A common name for the era of the 
                Messiah, which was so called because the advent of the Christ would bring 
                comfort to his people (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 40: 1</span></span>). 
                Jews swore by the consolation of Israel, and the phrase, "May I see the 
                consolation of Israel," was common among them. A prayer for the coming of 
                the Messiah was daily used by them</span>): and the Holy Spirit was upon 
            him. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1: 68.</span></span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span>     And it had 
            been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit (<span class="comm">probably in a dream</span>), 
            that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. (<span class="comm">A 
                remarkable favor, a notable blessing--<span class="style7">Luke 10:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span>    And he came in the Spirit (<span class="comm">moved by the impulses

                little; those who go in the Spirit--according to the measure in which He 
                is given them--see and hear much</span>): and when the parents brought 
            in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span>     then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and

                Simeon is called the "Nunc Dimittis" from the two words with 
                which the Latin translation of it begins. Simeon regards his death as now near, 
                since he had seen that for which God had kept him alive. He represents as a 
                sentinel who, seeing the rising of the day-star which is the signal that his 
                watch is relieved, knows his weary waiting is at an end</span>), Lord, 
            According to thy word (<span class="comm">God keeps his word, and never disappoints</span>), 
            in peace (<span class="comm">to the living the Jews said, "Go in peace"

                his eyes the world looks poor indeed, and the loss of it appears 
                gain--<span class="style7">Phillipians 1: 21</span></span>),   </p>

                prophets--<span class="style7">Acts 3: 18</span></span>) before the face of all peoples (<span class="comm">The 
                Jewish Scriptures were then scattered among all nations, and all people were 
                acquainted with the Hebrew expectations of a Messiah. Simeon saw in the Babe 
                the initial step of God toward fulfilling all these prophecies</span>);   </p>

                Father to the Gentiles. That Simeon should prophesy this is an evidence of the 
                large spiritual knowledge given him, since even the apostles were slow to grasp 
                the fullness of Christ's world-wide mission--see <span class="style7">Psalms 98: 2, 3; Isaiah 52: 10; 42: 6</span></span>) to the Gentiles,

                Israel is doubly glorified in Jesus, in that God chose this people to receive 
                the Word, or divine Son, in that Jesus, as a Jew, presented to the world the 
                picture of the perfect manhood. In his divinity and his humanity Jesus 
                glorified Israel</span>) of thy people Israel. (<span class="comm">The Gentiles and Israel are

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span>    And his father and

            (<span class="comm">Not because they heard anything which was really new, but because the words 
                caused them to see the truth in a new way. They were also doubtless surprised 
                to find that an utter stranger should speak thus about the child. Such

                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Peter 2: 7, 8; Acts 4: 11; 1 Corinthians 3: 
                        11</span></span>). Jesus is the cornerstone of true religion. Those who reject him 
                fall over him and are broken; those who accept him, build upon him, and are 
                lifted up and edified</span>) 

            for the falling and the rising of many in 
            Israel (<span class="comm">Jesus has always wrought changes which were like fallings and 
                risings. In his own early lifetime Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, Nazarenes, 
                Gadarenes, etc., sank down before his example and teaching; while fishermen, 
                publicans and outcasts were elevated and encouraged by his sympathy. In the 
                ecclesiastical field Jesus has brought down the powers of superstition and 
                priestcraft, and exalted the common worshiper, giving him liberty of 
                conscience. In the political field Jesus has brought down the pride of kings 
                and lifted up the common people, and given them sovereign powers. In the 
                spiritual realm this work of Jesus is most clearly displayed. Not only did he 
                bring down the pride of Judah and lift up the despised Gentiles (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 9: 25</span></span>); but he has worked a leveling and a 
                lifting work in the life of each of his followers. Those proud of their 
                manhood, he has made as children, that they might become truly men (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 18: 3</span></span>); those wise in their own conceit, 
                he approaches with the foolishness of preaching, that they might be instructed 
                in true learning (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 1: 
                        26 - 31</span></span>); those strong in self-confidence, he makes weak, that 
                he may fill them with the divine power (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Corinthians 
                        12: 10; Phil. 4: 13</span></span>). Like Paul, we fall and rise in 
                Christ--<span class="style7">Acts 9: 4 - 6</span></span>);
            and for a sign (<span class="comm">Something which challenges attention, and is full of 
                significant meaning. Signs were intended to allay controversy, and to exclude 
                contradiction, but Jesus provoked both. When he was thus first in the temple, 
                opposition was prophesied; when he was last there it was fully 
                realized--<span class="style7">Matthew 23: 38</span></span>) 
            which is spoken against (<span class="comm">during his earthly lifetime Jesus was called 
                "deceiver," "Samaritan," "demoniac," etc., 
                and subsequently his followers were abused (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 
                        28: 22</span></span>); later the Jews wrote of him as "the 
                deceiver," "that man," and "the hung." Early 
                Christians were charged by the pagans with committing cannibalism, incest, and 
                every conceivable atrocity, and in this day "Christian" 
                is--after Jew--the most stringing term of reproach known to the 
                Eastern tongue</span>);   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span>   yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own 
            soul (<span class="comm">Simeon had read and 

                understood the prophecies which told 
                of the suffering Messiah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 42: 
                        14-43: 12</span></span>). Hence, to prepare the soul of Mary he touches this 
                minor chord. By as much as the prophecies and annunciations concerning Jesus, 
                led Mary to expect honor, and glory for her son; by so much did the rejection, 
                persecution and cruel death of Jesus overwhelm her with piercing anguish and 
                disappointment. It is also probable that at the time of the crucifixion Mary 
                shared with the apostles the doubts as to the mission of Jesus, and these 
                doubts must have been unspeakably bitter to her</span>); that thoughts out 
            of many hearts may be revealed. (<span class="comm">The word here translated 
                "thoughts" is generally used to signify bad or evil thoughts. Jesus 
                often revealed such (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 9: 16</span></span>); but 
                the context shows that Simeon had in mind the evil thoughts which were revealed 
                by the sufferings inflicted on Christ. The human heart is desperately wicked 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 17: 9</span></span>); but its wickedness was 
                never more manifest than when it chose a murderer and crucified its Creator 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 3: 14, 15</span></span>). Men are still 
                revealed by their attitude toward Christ, the sincere being drawn to him, and 
                the hypocrites being repelled from him. But at the judgment he shall shine 
                forth as the perfect revealer of all thoughts and actions--<span class="style7">Matthew 10: 26.</span></span>)  </p>

                commemorate the days when Moses was supposed to have ascended and descended Mt. 
                Sinai; viz.: on Monday and Thursday. They had also otherwise multiplied the 
                fasts--<span class="style7">Luke 5: 33</span></span>) and 
            supplications night and day. (<span class="comm">In Hebrew idiom night is mentioned before 
                day, following the example of Moses (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 1: 
                        5</span></span>). The Hebrew theory that "God made the world in six days and 
                seven nights," may have given birth to this idiom. For instances of this 
                idiom, see <span class="style7">Acts 26: 7; 1 Timothy 5: 5</span>. 
                There were probably night services of sacred music held in the temple, at which 
                priests sung anthems--<span class="style7">Psalms 134: 1, 2; 119: 
                    62.</span></span>)   </p>

            God, and spake of him (<span class="comm">Jesus</span>) to all them that were looking for the

            Lord, they returned. (<span class="comm">Luke here adds the words "into Galilee, to 
                their own city, Nazareth." We have omitted these words from the text 
                here, and carried them forward to Section 12, where they 
                rightfully belong. Luke omits to tell that Jesus returned to Nazareth by way of 
                Bethlehem and Egypt. Such omissions are common in all biographies, and this one 
                is paralleled by Luke himself in his life of Paul. Compare <span class="style7">Acts 9: 19 - 26 with Galatians 1: 17, 18.</span></span>) </p>
