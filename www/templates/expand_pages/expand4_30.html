        <h3>30. JESUS CALLS FOUR FISHERMEN.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">SEA OF GALILLEE, NEAR CAPERNAUM.</span>).</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 4: 18-22;  MARK 1: 16-20;  LUKE 5: 1-11.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4: 18</span>     And walking </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 16</span>    And passing along by the sea of Galilee (<span class="comm">This lake is a pear-shaped body 
                of water, about twelve and a half miles long and about seven miles across at 
                its widest place. It is 682 feet below sea level; its waters are fresh, clear 
                and abounding in fish, and it is surrounded by hills and mountains, which rise 
                from 600 to 1,000 feet above it. Its greatest depth is about 165 feet</span>), 
            he (<span class="comm">Jesus</span>) saw  two brethren, Simon who is 
            called Peter, and Andrew his brother, {the brother of 
            Simon} casting a net in {into} the sea (<span class="comm">The New 
                Testament speaks of three kinds of nets, viz.: the amphiblestron, which 
                is only mentioned here; the sagene, mentioned only at  <span class="style7">Matthew 13: 47</span>; and the dictua, which is 
                mentioned in all other places. The dictua was a casting-net; the 
                sagene, a seine or dragnet; and the amphiblestron was a drawnet, a 
                circular bell-shaped affair, which was thrown upon the water, so that it spread 
                out and 

                caught, by sinking, whatever was below it</span>); for 
            they were fishers. (<span class="comm">Though Simon and Andrew had been companions of Jesus on 
                at least one journey, they did not as yet understand that his service would 
                require all their time. The facts that Jesus now temporarily resided at 
                Capernaum afforded them an opportunity to return to their old occupation, which 
                they readily embraced. Fishing was then a prosperous trade on the lake of 
                Galilee.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span>    And Jesus said {
            he saith}  unto them, Come ye after me, and I 
            will make you to become fishers of men. (<span class="comm">It was an invitation to follow, 
                that they might be instructed by hearing his teaching and beholding his work. 
                Jesus called them from a lower to a similar but higher labor. He calls all 
                honest tradesmen in this manner. He invites carpenters to build his temple, 
                servants to serve the great King, physicians to heal immortal souls, merchants 
                to invest in pearls of great price, etc. The fisherman found many points of 
                resemblance between the old and new calling, such as, 1, daily hardships and 
                dangers; 2, earnest desires for the objects sought; 3, skill and wisdom in the 
                use of means, etc. Disciples are fishers, human souls are fish, the world is 
                the sea, the gospel is the net, and eternal life is the shore whither the catch 
                is drawn.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4: 21</span>    And going on from thencea little further,  he saw two other 
            brethren, James the son of 
            Zebedee, and John his brother,  who also were in the 
            boat  with Zebedee their father, mending their {
            the} nets. (<span class="comm">They also, like Peter and Andrew, were at 
                work when Jesus found them. God calls the busy to his business. For instances 
                where God had called the busy, see cases of Moses (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 3: 1, 2</span></span>), Gideon (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Judges 6: 11</span></span>), Saul (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Samuel 10: 1-3</span></span>), David (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Samuel 16: 11-15</span></span>), Elisha (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 19: 19-21</span></span>), Matthew (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 9: 9</span></span>), 
                Saul  (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 9: 1-6</span></span>). Moreover most of these were called from lowly work, for such is God's method 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 1: 26-29</span></span>). We should 
                note two reasons why God chose the lowly and unlearned: 1, their minds being 
                free from prejudice were more ready to entertain new truth; 2, the strength of 
                the gospel was made more apparent by the 

                weakness of its ministers 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 2: 3-5; 2 Corinthians 4: 7; Zechariah 4: 
                        6</span></span>). Of these two brothers, James was the first apostolic martyr and 
                John the last survivor of the twelve. James was beheaded about a.d. 44 (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 12: 1, 2</span></span>); and John, after upwards of seventy years of Christian service, died at Ephesus about A.D. 100.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 20</span>   And straightway he 
            called them (<span class="comm">From Matthew and Mark we would suppose that Jesus was alone 
                when he called the two sets of brothers, and that with them he immediately left 
                the lake. But we learn from Luke that he taught and worked a miracle before 
                leaving the lake</span>):  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 5: 1</span>    Now it came to pass, 
            while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was 
            standing by the lake of Gennesaret (<span class="comm">This body of water bore many names. It 
                was anciently called Chinnereth (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 34: 11</span></span>), or Chinneroth (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Judges 12: 3</span></span>), from a fortified town (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Joshua 19: 35 </span></span>) 
                and district (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 15: 20</span></span>) in Naphtali bearing that name. It is here called Gennesaret, from a plain of that name upon its northwestern shore (<span class="comm">which may be a corruption of the old name Chinnereth.</span>) It received its name, Galilee, from the district to which it belongs, and in later times it bore the name Tiberias (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 6: 1</span></span>), from the city of that name 
                on its western shore</span>); </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span>   and he saw two boats standing by the lake: 
            but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. (<span class="comm">We 
                may conceive of the fishermen, in answer to Jesus' call, drawing their boats 
                together to the point where he stood upon the shore. Then, as Jesus stood 
                teaching, they occupied themselves in the shallow water behind by washing their 
                nets while they listened to him.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span>   And he entered into one of the boats, 
            which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. (<span class="comm">He did 
                this that he might avoid the press, and that the people might be better able 
                both to see and to hear.</span>) And he sat down (<span class="comm">the usual attitude or posture 
                of a teacher</span>) and taught the multitudes out of the boat. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span>   And 
            when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let 
            down your nets for a 

            draught. (<span class="comm">"Put out" is 
                in the singular, being addressed to Simon alone; "let down" is 
                plural, being addressed generally to those in the boat.</span>)  </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span>   And Simon 
            answered and said, Master, we have toiled all the night, and took nothing: but 
            at thy word I will let down the nets. (<span class="comm">"Master" is a broader 
                word than "Rabbi"; it indicates a superior, but does not confine 
                his superiority to matters of instruction. The words of Peter show a 
                willingness to oblige or honor Jesus, but are devoid of hope as to the thing 
                proposed. Night was the time for fishing (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 21: 3</span></span>); and the proper place to cast the net was near the shore; 
                but if Jesus wished to fish by daylight in the middle of the lake, Simon was 
                not too weary to humor the wish.</span>) </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span>   And when they had done this, they 
            inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking (<span class="comm">that 
                is, the nets began to snap when they tried to lift them out of the water</span>)
            ; </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span>   and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they 
            should come and help them. (<span class="comm">This indicates that they were well out into the 
                lake, where it was easier to beckon than to shout explanations. Some think the 
                marvel wrought by Jesus made them speechless, but they were so engrossed in the 
                magnitude and value of the catch that the full glory of the miracle had not yet 
                come upon them.</span>) And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they 
            began to sink. (<span class="comm">They probably ran a second net under the one which enclosed 
                the fishes, and by thus doubling the strength of the net were able to draw the 
                fish up between the boats. A great load thus suddenly dumped in the side of a 
                boat will cause it to list, dip water and threaten to sink. Such appears to 
                have been the case here until the loads were so distributed as to right the 
                ships.</span>) </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span>   But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, 
            saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span>   For he 
            was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they 
            had taken (<span class="comm">This miracle came home to the soul of Peter because it was 
                wrought in his own boat, with his own nets, and concerned his own business. 

                Religion is only powerful as it becomes personal. Peter's request 
                shows how deeply the miracle impressed him. It gave him that sense of the 
                divine presence which never fails to overwhelm the hearts of men. No man can 
                behold God in his glory and live (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 33: 20-23; 20: 18, 19</span></span>); and though there have been exceptions 
                where men have seen God or his representatives and lived (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 24: 9-11; Judges 6: 21-23; 13: 22, 23; Isaiah 6: 1-5; Daniel 10: 16-19; Genesis 32: 30</span></span>); yet no man, not 
                even the purest, has ever stood in the presence of God or his ministers without 
                feeling such a sense of weakness and sinfulness as to almost extinguish 
                life--<span class="style7">Revelation 1: 17; Job 42: 5, 6</span></span>)
            ; </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span>   and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners 
            with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt 
            catch men. (<span class="comm">Jesus here shows the purpose for which this miracle had been 
                wrought. It was a prophetic type or picture which foreshadowed the triumphs of 
                the day of Pentecost and other seasons when the apostles had great ingatherings 
                of souls through the preaching of the gospel.</span>)  </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And when they had brought their boats to land, they straightway left all (<span class="comm">that is to say, Peter and Andrew</span>),left the nets (<span class="comm">but James and John</span>), left the boat and their father, Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. {followed him} (<span class="comm">The four partners, boats, different kinds of nets, hired servants, etc., and the fact that Salome, the wife of Zebedee, was one of those who ministered to Christ out of her substance (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 27: 55, 56; Luke 8: 3</span></span>), all indicate a business of 
                respectable proportions: a fact which suggests that the church of Christ would 
                catch more souls if all its parts were in partnership. Evidently when the four 
                men left the boats and nets Zebedee took charge of them. While the four rightly 
                recognized that the divine call was superior to their earthly obligations, 
                there is nothing which leads us to imply that their sudden departure 
                discomfited Zebedee. The call of Christ here marks a change in their 
                relationship to him. Hitherto discipleship had not materially interfered with 


                business, but this present call separated them from their 
                occupation, and prepared them for the call to be apostles which came later, and 
                which required them to be his constant companions--<span class="style7">Mark 3: 14.</span></span>)</p>
