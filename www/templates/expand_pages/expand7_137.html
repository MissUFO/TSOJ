        <h3>137. CAIAPHAS AND THE SANHEDRIN.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PALACE OF CAIAPHAS. FRIDAY.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 26: 57, 59-68;  MARK 14: 53, 55-65;<br>LUKE 22: 54, 63-65;  JOHN 18: 24.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 24</span> Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas 
            the high priest. (<span class="comm">Foiled in his attempted examination of Jesus, Annas sends 
                him to trial.</span>)   and there come together with him all the 
            chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 57</span> And they that had taken Jesus led him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest,
            and brought him into the high priest's house.where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. (<span class="comm">It 
                is very likely that Annas had apartments in the same palace with Caiaphas, and 
                that from these apartments Jesus was led into some hall large enough to hold 
                the Sanhedrin, which was now convened. But this was not its formal session as a 
                court; it was more in the nature of a caucus, or committee of the whole.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 55</span> Now the chief priests and the whole council 
            sought  false witness against Jesus,  
            to {that they might} put him to death;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 60</span> and they found it not, though many false witnesses came.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 56</span> For many bare false witness against him, and their 
            witness agreed not together.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 60</span> But afterward came {And there stood up <span class="style5">Mark 14: 57</span>} certain, two,  and bare false witness against 
            him,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">61</span> and said, {saying,}  This man said, I am able to destroy 
            the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 58</span> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with 
            hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">59</span> And not even so did their witness agree together. (<span class="comm">What Jesus 

                had really said will be found at <span class="style7">John 2: 19-22</span>. Though his words were misunderstood at that time, 
                being applied, not to his body, but to Herod's temple, yet it is not unlikely 
                that the Jewish rulers, hearing our Lord's prediction that he would rise from 
                the dead after three days (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 27: 62-63</span></span>), came to understand the import of his words. If so, the record 
                itself shows the willingness of the Sanhedrin to receive false witnesses 
                against Christ, for its judges received testimony which they knew to be utterly 
                immaterial if rightly construed. The accounts of the two Evangelists, moreover, 
                show how the witnesses failed to agree. A man could only be condemned on the 
                testimony of two witnesses as to some fact or facts constituting a ground for 
                condemnation--<span class="style7">Deuteronomy 17: 6; 19: 15</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 62</span> And the high priest stood up,in the midst, and asked Jesus,  and said 
            unto him, {saying,} Answerest thou nothing? what is 
            it which these witness against thee?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">63</span> But Jesus held his peace.  and 
            answered nothing. (<span class="comm">While the testimony then before the court might be used 
                to show that Jesus was recklessly boastful, it was insufficient to justify a 
                sentence of blasphemy. A threat to destroy the temple might be thus construed 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 26: 9-11; Acts 6: 13-14</span></span>); but a promise to rebuild the temple, if destroyed, was 
                altogether different. The high priest, knowing this, sought to extort from 
                Jesus some additional evidence. With great cunning and effrontery he assumes 
                that the testimony is all that could be possibly desired, and demands of Jesus 
                what he has to say in answer to it. But our Lord did not suffer himself to seem 
                so easily deceived. He gave no explanation, since the future would explain his 
                meaning, and speak the real truth to all who had ears to hear it.</span>) And  Again the high priest asked him, and 
            saith {said} unto him,  Art 
            thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?  I adjure thee 
            by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of 
            God. (<span class="comm">Seeing that Jesus was not to be lured into an answer, and well 
                knowing his perfect frankness, Caiaphas resolved, in his desperation, to 
                question Jesus plainly and 

                bluntly. His question is twofold: 1. 
                Art thou Christ? 2. Art thou the Son of God? The latter of these would 
                constitute blasphemy, and the former, by showing a boastful spirit, would tend 
                to confirm the charge. Perhaps, too, Caiaphas anticipated the future, and 
                foresaw how useful this claim to be the Messiah would prove when a hearing was 
                had before Pilate (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 2</span></span>). 
                Originally the Messiah was recognized as the Son of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 2: 7</span></span>), but if the Jews had ever generally entertained such 
                an idea, they had lost it before Jesus' day, The Messiah might of course be 
                called the Son of God in that secondary sense in which Adam was thus called 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 49; Luke 3: 38</span></span>). But Jesus 
                had used the term in an entirely different sense, and his usage had been 
                extremely offensive to the Jews (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 17-18; 10: 30-39; Matt. 22: 41-46</span></span>). Caiaphas evidently wished 
                Jesus to answer this question in that new sense which the Lord had given to the 
                words. Caiaphas had no legal right to ask either of these questions. No man can 
                be compelled to testify against himself, but he knew the claims of Jesus, and 
                realized that if Jesus repudiated them he would be shamed forever, and if he 
                asserted them he could be charged with blasphemy. Taking advantage, therefore, 
                of the situation, Caiaphas put the question with the usual formula of an oath, 
                thus adding moral power to it, for, under ordinary circumstances, one was held 
                guilty if he refused to answer when thus adjured (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 5: 1</span></span>). When their own witnesses failed, these rulers called the 
                "faithful witness"--<span class="style7">1 Timothy 6: 13; Revelation 1: 5</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 62</span> And Jesus said, {saith} unto him, Thou hast said:  
            I am: and  nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye 
            shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on {with} the clouds of heaven. (<span class="comm">Jesus freely confessed 
                the truth which his church is called upon to confess. "Right hand of 
                Power" was commonly understood to mean the right hand of God. By the 
                words "nevertheless" and "henceforth" Jesus brings the 
                present state of humiliation into contrast with his future state of glory. Hard 
                as it might be for them to believe it, the day would come when he should 

                sit in judgment and they should stand on trial before him.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 65</span> Then {And <span class="style5">Mark 14: 63</span>} the high priest rent his 
            garments, {clothes,} and saith, {saying,} He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of 
            witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">66</span>  what think ye? (<span class="comm">Though Jesus had given the very answer which the high 
                priest was longing to hear, yet he hypocritically pretends to be shocked at it, 
                and rends his clothes and feigns horror. Evidently he feared the effect of the 
                clear, calm answer of Jesus and sought to counteract its influence on his 
                colleagues.</span>) They answered and said, He is worthy of death.And they all condemned him to be worthy of death. (<span class="comm">This was 
                not the final, formal sentence, but the mere determination of the council at 
                the preliminary hearing.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 63</span> And the men that 
            held Jesus mocked him, and beat 
            him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 65</span> And some began to spit on him, 
            and to cover his face,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 67</span> Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: {<span class="style5">Luke 22: 64 </span>And they blindfolded him,} and some smote him with the palms of their hands,
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">68</span> saying, {and
            (<span class="comm">began</span>) to say unto him,}  Prophesy unto us, thou 
            Christ: who is he that struck thee?  and the officers 
            received him with blows of their hands.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 65</span> And many other things spake they against him, reviling him. (<span class="comm">To spit in 
                the face has been an insult in all ages and in all lands. See <span class="style7">Numbers 12: 14; Deuteronomy 25: 9; Job 30: 10</span>. Jesus, 
                having stood out for examination, is now given back to the officers to be led 
                away into the council chamber. These officers received Jesus with many 
                indignities. They seek to make his high claims contemptible, and to make it 
                appear that instead of being divine he is hardly worthy to be regarded as 
                human.</span>)
