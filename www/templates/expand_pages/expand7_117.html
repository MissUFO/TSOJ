        <h3>(<span class="comm">ROAD FROM BETHANY AND JERUSALEM. <br>MONDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 21: 18, 19, 12, 13;  MARK 11: 12Ð18; LUKE 19: 45Ð48.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 12</span>   And  

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 18</span>   Now  on the morrow (<span class="comm">on the Monday following the 
                triumphal entry</span>),  in the morning  
            when they were come out from Bethany,  as he 
            returned to the city (<span class="comm">Jerusalem</span>), he hungered. (<span class="comm">Breakfast 
                with the Jews came late in the forenoon, and these closing days of our Lord's 
                ministry were full of activity that did not have time to tarry at Bethany for 
                it. Our Lord's hunger implies that of the disciples also.</span>) 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span>   And seeing a 
            fig tree by the way side,  afar off having leaves,
            he came to it,  if haply he might 
            find anything thereon: and when he came to it, 

            he found nothing but leaves only;  for 
            it was not the season of figs. (<span class="comm">Two varieties of figs are common in 
                Palestine. The bicura or boccore, an early fig with large green leaves and with 
                fruit which ripens in May or June, and sometimes earlier near Jerusalem. 
                Thomson found ripe fruit of this variety as early as May in the mountains of 
                Lebanon, a hundred fifty miles north of Jerusalem, and Professor Post, of 
                Beyrut, states that fig-trees there have fruit formed as early as February, 
                which is fully ripe in April. The second variety is the summer fig or kermus. 
                This ripens its main crop in August, but its later fruitage often hangs on all 
                winter when the weather is mild, dropping off when the new spring leaves come. 
                As the fruit usually appears before the leaves, the leaves were a promise that 
                fruit might be found, and the fruit, though not perfectly ripe, is considered 
                edible when the leaves are developed. Though it was too early for fruit, it was 
                also too early for leaves. The tree evidently had an unusually favorable 
                position. It seemed to vaunt itself by being in advance of the other trees, and 
                to challenge the wayfarer to come and refresh himself.</span>) 


        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 14</span>   And he answered 
            and said {saith} unto it, Let there be no fruit from 
            thee henceforward for ever.  No man eat fruit of thee 
            henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.  And 
            immediately the fig tree withered away. (<span class="comm">The disciples did not pause to 
                watch the effect of Christ's words upon the tree. But from the degree to which 
                it had shriveled when they saw it next day it became evident to them that it 
                had begun to wither as soon as Christ had finished uttering its sentence. Our 
                Lord here performed a miracle of judgment unlike any other of his wonderful 
                works. The reader can hardly fail to note how perfectly this fig-tree, in its 
                separation from the other trees, its showy pretensions, its barrenness of 
                results and its judgment typifies the Jewish people. In fact, Christ's 
                treatment of it appears in some respects to be a visible and practical 
                application of the principles which he had formerly set forth in a parable 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 13: 6Ð9</span></span>). But we must 
                not too confidently make such an application of the parable since Jesus himself 
                gave 

                no hint that he intended us so to apply it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>   And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, 
            and began to cast out  all them that soldand them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of 
            the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold the doves (<span class="comm">three years 
                before, Jesus had thus cleansed the temple at the first passover of his 
                ministry, for an account of which see pp. 121Ð125</span>); 


        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple. (<span class="comm">The temple space being level and roomy tempted the people of Jerusalem to use it as a thoroughfare, or short-cut from one part of the city to another, but Jesus did not permit them to carry any sack, bag, jug, pail, basket, parcel or such like thing through the sacred enclosure. The Greek word skeuos which is here translated &quot;vessel&quot; embraces all kinds of household furniture. It is translated &quot;goods&quot; at <span class="style7">Matthew 12: 29</span> and <span class="style7"> Luke 17: 31</span>. The LXX. uses it as equivalent to &quot;instruments of war&quot; at <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 1: 41</span>, and to &quot;vestments&quot; at <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 22: 5</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 19: 46</span>   Saying unto them, It is 
            written (<span class="comm">the prophecy cited is a combination of <span class="style7">Isaiah 56: 7</span> and <span class="style7">Jeremiah 7: 11</span></span>), {
            Is it not written,}  And my house shall be {
            shall be called} a house of prayer for all the nations? 
            but ye have made {ye make} it a den of robbers. 
            (<span class="comm">The caves in certain sections of Palestine have been immemorially infested 
                with robbers, and Jesus, because of the injustice of extortion practiced by the 
                merchants, likens the polluted temple to such a den. The dickering and chafing 
                and market talk were probably not unlike the grumbling and quarreling of 
                thieves as they divide the booty.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 18</span>   And the

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 19: 47</span>  And he was

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span>   and they 
            could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, 
            listening  for all the people was astonished at his 
            teaching. (<span class="comm">Overawed by the magnitude 

                of the popular 
                demonstration made on Sunday, the Jewish rulers feared to attempt any violent 
                measures in dealing with Jesus. But they neglected no opportunity by appeals to 
                Jesus himself, by treacherous questions, etc., to divert the popular favor from 
                the Lord that they might put him to death.</span>)
