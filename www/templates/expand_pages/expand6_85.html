        <h3>85. FORGIVENESS BETWEEN BRETHREN.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AUTUMN, A.D. 29.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 18: 15-35.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And if thy brother sin against thee, go, show him 
            his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy 
            brother. (<span class="comm">Having warned against giving offense, Jesus now shows how to act 
                when offense is received. The fault is to be pointed out to the offender, but 
                for the purpose of gaining him--not from a desire to humiliate him. The 
                offended is to seek the offender, 

                and the offender is likewise to 
                seek the offended (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matt. 15: 23-24</span></span>), 
                and neither is to wait for the other.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> But if he hear thee not, take with thee one or two more, 
            that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established. 
            (<span class="comm">Reconciliation is still to be sought, but witnesses are now to be called in 
                preparatory to the next step, which is the hearing before the church, wherein 
                their testimony will be needed.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And if he refuse to hear them, tell it 
            unto the church: but if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee 
            as the gentile and the publican. (<span class="comm">As the Saviour was giving preparatory 
                instruction, he was compelled to thus speak of the church by anticipation 
                before it actually existed. The word "church" means assembly, and 
                the apostles knew that there would be some form of assembly in the kingdom 
                about to be set up. When Matthew wrote his Gospel, churches were already in 
                existence. One who will not hear the church is to be regarded as an outsider. 
                This implies that such a one is to be excluded from the church.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> Verily I 
            say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in 
            heaven: and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in 
            heaven. (<span class="comm">The binding and loosing here mentioned is limited by the context 
                or the subject of which Jesus now treats. Binding represents exclusion from 
                membership; loosing, the restoration to fellowship in cases of repentance. The 
                church's act in thus binding or loosing will be recognized in heaven if 
                performed according to apostolic precept or precedent. Hence it is a most 
                august and fearful prerogative.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Again I say unto you, that if two of you 
            shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done 
            for them of my Father which is in heaven.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> For where two or 
            three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. 
            (<span class="comm">These two verses illustrate the sublime power of the church which has just 
                been suggested by its right of excommunication. A small church of two or three 
                can prevail with God in prayer 

                (<span class="comm">in matters not wholly at variance 
                    with his will</span>) and can be honored by the very presence of the Christ.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, 
            and I forgive him? until seven times? (<span class="comm">Peter, seeing that the language of 
                Jesus called for large forbearance, asked the Lord to fix the bounds. If we 
                accept the Talmud as probably representing the ideals of forgiveness which 
                pertained among the Jews of that age, we find that Peter was striving to be 
                liberal, for the Talmud limits forgiveness to three times.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> Jesus saith 
            unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times 
            seven. (<span class="comm">Jesus here plays upon the words so as to show that there is no 
                numerical limitation. To keep track of four hundred ninety offenses one would 
                have to open a set of books with his neighbor, which would be ridiculous. 
                Forgiveness, prayer, and charity know no arithmetic. Peter's question brings to 
                mind the forgiveness of God and calls forth the following parable.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make 
            a reckoning with his servants.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> And when he had begun to reckon, 
            one was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents. (<span class="comm">Assuming 
                that the silver talent is meant (<span class="comm">$1,600</span>), the debt was $16,000,000, which would 
                render the debtor hopeless enough. If it was a gold talent, it would be nearly 
                twenty times as much.

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> But forasmuch as he had not wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to 
                    be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be 
                    made. (<span class="comm">The law of Moses allowed such a sale--<span class="style7">Leviticus 25: 39-47; 2 Kings 4: 1</span>.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> The servant 
                    therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, 
                    and I will pay thee all.

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> And the lord of that servant, being 
                    moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. (<span class="comm">Seeing the 
                        man's apparent willingness to pay, and knowing the hopelessness of his offer to 
                        do so, the lord compassionately forbore to sell him and forgave him the whole 
                        debt.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> But that 

                    servant went out, and found one of 
                    his fellow-servants, who owed him an hundred shillings (<span class="comm">The denarius or 
                        shilling was worth about seventeen cents. The debt was, therefore, about 
                        $100</span>): and he laid hold on him, and took 
                    him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. (<span class="comm">This 
                        frenzy to collect might have been somewhat pardonable had the lord still been 
                        demanding his debt, but, that debt being forgiven, such harsh conduct was 
                        inexcusable.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> So his fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying, 
                    Have patience with me, and I will pay thee. (<span class="comm">Compare this conduct with that 
                        depicted in <span class="style7">Matthew 18: 26</span> above.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay 
                    that which was due. (<span class="comm">Prison life was far worse than slavery. The Roman law 
                        permitted such a punishment, and it was practiced in this country until after 
                        the beginning of the last century.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> So when his fellow-servants saw what 
                    was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that 
                    was done. (<span class="comm">They were sorry for the sin of the one and the suffering of the 
                        other. Human nature rarely grows so wicked that it fails to resent sin in 
                        others.

                        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Then his lord called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked 
                            servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me:

                        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> shouldest thou not also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I 
                            had mercy on thee? (<span class="comm">God's forgiveness places us under obligation to be 
                                forgiving. The lord does not call the servant wicked because he had contracted 
                                a debt which he could not pay, but because of the merciless, unforgiving spirit 
                                which he had manifested toward his fellow-servant. Thus God freely forgives sin 
                                against himself, but the sin of refusing to forgive our fellow-man is with him 
                                an unforgivable sin. No doctrine of the Bible is more plainly taught than 
                                this.</span>)

                        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till 
                            he should pay all that was due. (<span class="comm">The picture is to be interpreted by the 
                                usages of the East, where even at the present day torture is used to compel 
                                debtors to confess the 

                                possession of property which they suspected 
                                of hiding. Thus the man had escaped being sold into slavery only to receive 
                                sentence of death by torture.</span>)

                        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> So shall also my heavenly Father do unto 
                            you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts. (<span class="comm">Jesus 
                                reminds us that God is a Father unto him whom we have refused to forgive. The 
                                key to the parable is introduced by the words, "So shall also." God 
                                will so deliver to the tormentors the unforgiving. Incidentally the parable 
                                draws comparisons between the forgiving spirit of God and the revengeful spirit 
                                of man, and the magnitude of our debt to him and the insignificance of our 
                                debts to each other. The retraction of forgiveness is merely a part of the 
                                parabolic drapery, but it is nevertheless true that those who are delivered 
                                from sin come to a worse state than ever if they return to it--<span class="style7">2 Peter 2: 20-22</span>.</span>)
