        <h3>119C. THIRD GROUP OF PARABLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE. <br>TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>THE WICKED HUSBANDMEN.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 21: 33-46;  MARK 12: 1-12;  LUKE 20: 9-19.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 1</span>   And he began to speak unto them  
            the people (<span class="comm">not the rulers</span>)   in parables. {this parable:}  
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 33</span>   Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder (<span class="comm">this party 
                represents God</span>), who planted a vineyard (<span class="comm">this represents the 
                Hebrew nationality</span>), and set a hedge about it, and digged a
            pit for the  winepress in it 
            (<span class="comm">The winepress consisted of two tub-shaped cavities dug in the rock at 
                different levels, the upper being connected with the lower by an orifice cut 
                through from its bottom. Grapes were placed in the upper cavity, or trough, and 
                were trodden by foot. The juice thus squeezed from them ran through the orifice 
                to the trough below, from which it was taken and stored in leather bottles 
                until it fermented and formed wine</span>), and built a tower (<span class="comm">a place 
                where watchmen could be stationed to protect the vineyard from thieves as the 
                grapes ripened for the vintage</span>), and let it out to husbandmen 
            (<span class="comm">the rulers are here 

                represented; and the rental was, as usual, a 
                part of the fruits</span>), and went into another country.  
            for a long time. (<span class="comm">Jesus frequently refers to this withdrawal of the 
                visible presence of God from the world, always bringing out the point that the 
                withdrawal tests faithfulness. God had come down upon Mt. Sinai, given the law 
                and established the Hebrew nation, after which he had withdrawn. That had 
                indeed been a long time ago; and for four hundred years before the appearance 
                of John the Baptist, God had not even sent a messenger to demand fruit. Some 
                think the hedge refers to the manner in which Palestine was protected by sea 
                and desert and mountain, but the hedge and the winepress and the tower are mere 
                parabolic drapery, for every man who planted a vineyard did all three.</span>) 


        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span>   And when {at} the season
            of the fruits drew near,  he sent 
            unto the husbandmen a servant, {his servants} 
            i. e., the prophets</span>)   that they should give him {
            that he might receive  to receive 
            from the husbandmen} of the {his}  
            fruits of the vineyard. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 3: 8</span>--He expected the children of Israel to bring forth joy, love, 
                peace, and all the other goodly fruit of a godly life. And he looked to those 
                in authority to bring forth such results, and the prophets were sent to the 
                rulers to encourage them to do this.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 3</span>   And {but} 
            the husbandmen  took him, and beat him, and sent him 
            away empty, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span>   And again he sent unto them  yet another servant: him also they beat,  
            wounded in his head, and handled shamefully.  and sent 
            him away empty.  

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span>   And he 
            sent  yet  another;  a third: and him also they wounded,  and 
            him they killed:  and cast him forth.  
            and many others; beating some, and killing some. 


        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 35</span>   And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and 
            killed another, and stoned another. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span>   Again, he sent other 
            servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner. (<span class="comm">For 
                the treatment of the prophets, see such passages as <span class="style7">1 Kings 18: 13; 22: 24-27; 2 Kings 6: 31; 2 Chronicles 24: 19-22; 36: 15, 16</span>. For a summary of the treatment of 
                the prophets or messengers of God, 

                see <span class="style7">Hebrews 11: 35-38.</span></span>) 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span>   But
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 6</span>   He had yet one, a beloved son:  
            afterward  he sent him last unto them, </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 13</span>   And the lord of the vineyard said, {
            saying,}  What shall I do? (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 5: 4.</span></span>) I will send my beloved son; it may 
            be they will reverence him.  They will reverence my 
            son. (<span class="comm">The lord of the vineyard was thoroughly perplexed. The conduct of his 
                husbandmen was outrageous beyond all expectation. He had no better servants to 
                send them unless his only son should take upon him the form of a servant and 
                visit them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Phillipians 2: 5-8</span></span>). 
                Being tender and forgiving, and unwilling to resort to extreme measures, the 
                lord of the vineyard resolved to thus send his son, feeling sure that the son 
                would represent the person, authority and rights of the father so much better 
                than any other messenger (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 1: 1-5; 2: 1-3</span></span>), that it would be well-nigh impossible for the husbandmen 
                to fail of reverence towards him. In striking contrast, however, with this 
                expectation of the Father, the rulers, or the husbandmen, had just now harshly 
                demanded of the Son that he tell by what authority he did anything in the 
                vineyard.</span>)   

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 38</span>   But the {those}  husbandmen, when they saw {
            him}  the son,  they 
            reasoned one with another,  said among themselves, {saying,}  This is the heir; come, 
            let us kill him, and take his inheritance.  that the 
            inheritance may be ours.  and the inheritance shall be 
            ours. (<span class="comm">In thus bringing the story down to the immediate present, and 
                stating a counsel which his enemies had just spoken privately in each other's 
                ears, Jesus must have startled them greatly. He showed them, too, that those 
                things which made them deem it necessary to kill him were the very things which 
                proved his heirship. They regarded the Jewish nation as their property, and 
                they were plotting to kill Jesus that they might withhold it from him 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 12: 19; 11: 47-50</span></span>). That 
                men might hope by such high-handed lawlessness to obtain a title to a vineyard 
                seems incredible to us who have always been familiar with the even-balanced 
                justice of constitutional government; but in the East the looseness of 
                governments, the selfish apathy and lack 

                of public spirit among 
                the people, and the corrupt bribe-receiving habits of the judges makes our 
                Lord's picture even to this day, though rather exceptional, still true to life. 
                At this point Jesus turns from history to prophecy.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 8</span>   And they took him,
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 15</span>   And they cast him forth out of the 
            vineyard, and killed him. (<span class="comm">After two intervening days the Jews would 
                fulfill this detail by thrusting Jesus outside the walls of Jerusalem and 
                crucifying him there.</span>) </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 40</span>   When therefore the lord 
            of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen? </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span>   They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will 
            let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in 
            their seasons.  

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 16</span>  (<span class="comm">Jesus said</span>) He 
            will come and destroy these {the} husbandmen, and 
            will give the vineyard unto others.  And when they 
            heard it, they said, God forbid. (<span class="comm">Part of the multitude, hearing only the 
                story, pronounced unhesitatingly the judgment which ought to be inflicted upon 
                such evil-doers, and Jesus confirmed their judgment. But others, perceiving the 
                meaning underlying the parable, shrank from accepting what would otherwise have 
                been to them a very proper ending, and said, Mee genoito, which means 
                literally, Be it not so, and which might properly be paraphrased by our 
                emphatic "Never!" but which the revisers in translating have, with 
                small warrant, seen fit to paraphrase by using the semi-profane expression, 
                "God forbid." There are fourteen such mistranslations in the 
                epistles of Paul according to the King James version and only one of them 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galatians 6: 14</span></span>) is corrected in the 
                Revised version. In defense of these translations it is asserted that the 
                phrase is an idiomatic invocation of the Deity, but the case can not be made 
                out, since the Deity is not addressed.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span>   But he looked upon them (<span class="comm">Thus 
                emphasizing the fact that they had repudiated a most just decree. His look, 
                doubtless, resembled that of a parent surprised at the outspoken rebellion of 
                his children</span>), and  

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 42</span>   Jesus 
            saith {said,}  unto them,
            What then is this that is written, </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 10</span>   Have ye not read even this scripture:  
            Did ye never 

            read in the scriptures,  The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head 
            of the corner?  This was from the Lord, 
            And it is marvellous in our eyes? (<span class="comm">The quotation is from <span class="style7">Psalm 118: 22, 23</span>, which is here by Jesus 
                applied as a prophecy to the Pharisees, who, in their treatment of him, were 
                like unskilled builders who reject the very corner-stone of the building which 
                they seek to erect. The Pharisees were eager enough in their desire to set up a 
                Messianic kingdom, but were so blindly foolish that they did not see that this 
                kingdom could not be set up unless it rested upon Christ Jesus, its 
                corner-stone. They blundered in constructing their theory of the coming 
                kingdom, and could find no room for one such as Jesus in it.</span>) 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 43</span>   Therefore 
            say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given 
            to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> And he {<span class="style5">Luke 20: 18</span> Every one} that falleth on this {that} stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust. (<span class="comm">The stone, of course, represents Jesus, and the two fallings set forth his passive and active state. In the day when he passively submitted to be judged, those who condemned him were broken (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 27: 3-5; Luke 23: 48; Acts 2: 37</span></span>); but in the 
                great day when he himself becomes the acting party and calls his enemies to 
                judgment, they shall prefer, and pray, that a mountain fall upon 
                them--<span class="style7">Revelation 6: 15-17.</span></span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span>   And when the chief priests and Pharisees,  
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 19</span>   And the scribes  heard his parables, they
            sought to lay hands on him in that very hour,for they perceived that he  spake of 
            them.  spake the {this} 
            parable against them. </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 46</span>   And when they 
            sought to lay hands on him,  they feared the people: 
            {multitude;  multitudes,} 
            because they took him for a prophet.  and they left 
            him, and went away. (<span class="comm">Despite the warning which Jesus gave them that they 
                were killing the Son and would reap the consequences, and despite the fact that 
                he showed that the Psalm which the people had used so recently with regard to 
                him foretold a great rejection which would prove to be a 

                mistake, 
                yet the rulers persisted in their evil intention to take his life, and were 
                only restrained by fear of the people, many of whom were Galil&aelig;ans, men 
                of rugged courage, ready to draw swords on Jesus' behalf. Since they could 
                neither arrest nor answer him, they withdrew as a committee, but returned again 
                in the person of their spies.</span>)
