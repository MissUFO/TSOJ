        <h3>49. LAW CONCERNING JUDGING.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 7: 1-6;  LUKE 6: 37-42.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 7: 1</span>  Judge not, that ye be not judged. 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 37</span>  And judge not, and ye shall not be judged (<span class="comm">Here 
                again Jesus lays down a general principle in the form of universal prohibition. 
                The principle is, of course, to be limited by other Scriptural laws concerning 
                judgment. It does not prohibit: 1. Judgment by civil courts, which is 
                apostolically approved (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Peter 2: 13-15; Hebrew 13: 17; Titus 3: 1</span></span>). 2. Judgment of the church 
                on those who walk disorderly; for this also was ordered by Christ and his 
                apostles (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 18: 16, 17; Titus 3: 10; 2 Thessalonians 3: 6, 14; 2 John 10; 1 Timothy 1: 20; 6: 5</span></span>). 3. Private 
                judgment as to wrong-doers. This is also ordered by Christ and his apostles 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 7: 15, 16; Romans 16: 17; 1 John 4: 1; 1 Corinthians 5: 11</span></span>). The commandment is leveled at rash, censorious and 
                uncharitable judgments, and the fault-finding spirit or disposition which 
                condemns upon surmise without examination of the charges, forgetful that we 
                also shall stand in the judgment and shall need mercy (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 14: 10; James 2: 13</span></span>). Our judgment of Christians must 
                be charitable, (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 7: 24; 1 Corinthians 13: 5, 6</span></span>) in remembrance of the fact that they are God's servants 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 14: 4</span></span>); and that he reserves to 
                himself the ultimate right of judging 

                both them and 
                us--<span class="style7">Romans 14: 4; 1 Corinthians 4: 3, 4; 2 Corinthians 5: 10</span></span>):  
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 7: 2</span>  For with what judgment ye 
            judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured 
            unto you.  and condemn not, and ye shall not be 
            condemned: release, and ye shall be released (<span class="comm">Though God shall judge us 
                with absolute justice, yet justice often requires that we receive even in the 
                same measure in which we have given it, so in a sense the merciful receive 
                mercy, and the censorious receive censure (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 2: 12, 13</span></span>). But from men we receive judgment in the measure in 
                which we give it. Applying the teaching here given locally, we find that Jesus, 
                having condemned the Pharisees in their manner of praying, now turns to reprove 
                them for their manner of judging. Their censorious judgments of Christ himself 
                darken many pages of the gospel. But with a bitter spirit they condemned as 
                sinners beyond the pale of mercy whole classes of their countrymen, such as 
                publicans, Samaritans, and the like, besides their wholesale rejection of all 
                heathen. These bitter judgments swiftly returned upon the heads of the judges 
                and caused the victorious Roman to wipe out the Jewish leaders without mercy. 
                It is a great moral principle of God's government that we reap as we sow. 
                Censorious judgment and its harvest are merely one form of culture which comes 
                under this general law</span>): 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 38</span>  give, and it shall be given unto you; 
            good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into 
            your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.
            (<span class="comm">This is not necessarily a promise of the return of our gift in kind. It 
                rather means that we shall receive an equivalent in joy and in that blessedness 
                which Jesus meant when he said, "It is more blessed to give than to 
                receive." The figurative language is borrowed from the market where the 
                salesman, grateful for past kindnesses, endeavors, by pressing, shaking, and 
                piling up, to put more grain into the measure for us than it will contain. 
                Pockets were unknown to the ancients, and what they wished to take with them 
                was carried in the fold in the bosom of the coat, the girdle below holding it 
                up. 

                Ruth bore this a heavy burden in her mantle which, in the King 
                James Version is mistakenly called the veil--<span class="style7">Ruth 3: 15</span>.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span>  And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the 
            blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit? (<span class="comm">Whoso lacks 
                the knowledge of divine truth can not so lead others that they shall find it. 
                They shall both fall into the pitfalls of moral error and confusion.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span>  The 
            disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be 
            as his teacher. (<span class="comm">Pupils do not surpass their teachers, or, if they do, they 
                are self-taught, and hence do not owe to their teachers that wherein they rise 
                superior to them. All that the scholar can hope from his teacher is that when 
                he is perfectly instructed he shall be as his teacher. But if the teacher is a 
                blind man floundering in a ditch, he affords but a dismal prospect for his 
                pupils. The perfection of such teaching is certainly not desirable.</span>) 

        </p> 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span>  And why beholdest thou the mote (<span class="comm">chip or speck of wood 
                dust</span>) that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam (<span class="comm">heavy 
                house timber</span>) that is in thine own eye? 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 7: 4</span>  Or how 
            wilt (<span class="comm">canst</span>) thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me 
            cast out the mote  out of thine eye;  
            that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is 
            in thine own eye? (<span class="comm">and lo, the beam is in thine own 
                eye?</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span>  Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own 
            eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's 
            eye.  that is in thy brother's eye. (<span class="comm">In Matthew and 
                Luke Jesus gives slightly varying applications to this allegorical passage by 
                setting it in different connections. In Luke, as we see, he places it after the 
                words which describe the disastrous effect of being blind leaders of the blind. 
                It therefore signifies in this connection that we ourselves should first see if 
                we would teach others to see. In Matthew he places it after the words about 
                censorious judgment, where it means that we must judge ourselves before we can 
                be fit judges of others. The thought is practically the same, for there is 
                little difference between correcting others as their teachers or as 

                their self-appointed judges. Jesus graphically and grotesquely 
                represents a man with a log, or rafter, in his eye trying to take a chip or 
                splinter out of his neighbor's eye. Both parties have the same trouble or 
                fault, but the one having the greater seeks to correct the one having the less. 
                The application is that he who would successfully teach or admonish must first 
                be instructed or admonished himself (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galatians 6: 1</span></span>). In moral movements men can not be pushed; they must be led. 
                Hence those who would teach must lead the way. Those who have reformed their 
                own faults can "see clearly" how to help others. But so long as we 
                continue in sin, we are blind leaders of the blind.</span>)   
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span>  Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before 
            the swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, and turn and rend 
            you. (<span class="comm">The connection here is not obvious. This saying, however, appears to 
                be a limitation of the law against judging. The Christian must not be 
                censoriously judicial, but he should be discriminatingly judicious. He must 
                know dogs and swine when he sees them, and must not treat them as priests and 
                kings, the fit objects for the bestowal of holy food and goodly ornaments. Dogs 
                and swine were unclean animals. The former were usually undomesticated and were 
                often fierce. In the East they are still the self-appointed scavengers of the 
                street. The latter were undomesticated among the Jews, and hence are spoken of 
                as wild and liable to attack man. Meats connected with the sacrificial service 
                of the altar were holy. Even unclean men were not permitted to eat of them, 
                much less unclean brutes. What was left after the priests and clean persons had 
                eaten was to be burned with fire (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 6: 24-30; 7: 15-21</span></span>). To give holy things to dogs was to 
                profane them. We are here forbidden, then, to use any religious office, work, 
                or ordinance, in such a manner as to degrade or profane it. Saloons ought not 
                to be opened with prayer, nor ought adulterous marriages to be performed by a 
                man of God. To give pearls to swine is to press the claims of the gospel upon 
                those who despise it until they persecute you for annoying them with it. When 
                such men are known, 

                they are to be avoided. Jesus acted on this 
                principle in refusing to answer the Pharisees, and the apostles did the same in 
                turning to the Gentiles when their Jewish hearers would begin to contradict and 
                blaspheme. Compare <span class="style7">Matthew 15: 2, 3; 21: 23-27; Acts 13: 46; 19: 9</span>.</span>)
