        <h3>94. JESUS SENDS OUT SEVENTY.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY IN JUD&AElig;A, OCTOBER, A.D. 29.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 10: 1-24.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy 
            others (<span class="comm">i. e., other messengers in addition to the twelve 
                apostles</span>), and sent them two and two before his face into every city 
            and place, whither he himself was about to come. (<span class="comm">Luke has told us of the 
                journey through Samaria to Jerusalem, and John has told us what occurred at the 
                Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem. We learn from John also that Jesus was at 
                the Feast of Dedication (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 10: 22</span></span>). 
                The first feast was in October and the latter in December. Jesus evidently 
                spent the time between these feast in Jud&aelig;a, making a tour of that 
                province and sending the seventy before him, thus thoroughly evangelizing it as 
                he had Galilee, by sending out the twelve.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> Therefore he said unto them, 
            The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore 
            the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of 
            wolves.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man 
            on the way. (<span class="comm">This last was probably a common direction in cases of haste 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Kings 4: 29</span></span>). Eastern salutations 
                were tedious and overburdened with ceremony. Those in haste were excused from 
                them.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace
            be to this house.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it 
            shall turn to you again.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And in that same house remain, eating 
            and drinking such things as they give (<span class="comm">they were not to give trouble and 
                waste time by asking for better food</span>): for the laborer is worthy of 
            his hire. Go not from house to house.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And into whatsoever city 
            ye enter, and 

            they receive you, eat such things as are set 
            before you:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto 
            them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> But into 
            whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets 
            thereof and say, 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to 
            our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of 
            God is come nigh. (<span class="comm">For comment, see pp. 362-365.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> I say unto 
            you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the 
            mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they 
            would have long ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for 
            you.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? 
            thou shalt be brought down unto Hades. (<span class="comm">For comment on a similar passage, 
                see pp. 286, 287.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth 
            you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me. (<span class="comm">For 
                comment, see page 368.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, 
            even the demons are subject unto us in thy name. (<span class="comm">The report of the seventy 
                is more joyous than that of the twelve, for the sayings of the latter on their 
                return were overshadowed by the news of John the Baptist's death.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> And he 
            said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven. (<span class="comm">This may 
                be translated "I was beholding Satan fallen as lightning falls from 
                heaven." The sense indicates that the words refer to the victories over 
                the unclean spirits just reported by the seventy. In their successes Jesus saw 
                Satan falling from the lofty heights with the swiftness of lightning. The 
                overthrow of Satan was then in progress--<span class="style7">John 16: 11; 12: 31</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span>  Behold, I have given you authority to 
            tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and 
            nothing shall 

            in any wise hurt you. (<span class="comm">While the 
                messengers of Christ were, no doubt, literally protected from the poisons of 
                reptiles, etc. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 28: 3-6</span></span>), serpents and scorpions are here to be taken an emblematic of the powers of 
                evil.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject 
            unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. (<span class="comm">Your joy in 
                visible and temporal success, and in the subjection to you of the powers of 
                evil, is not to be compared to the joy that you have the prospect of heaven.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, 
            O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the 
            wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so 
            it was well-pleasing in thy sight.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> All things have been 
            delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the 
            Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son 
            willeth to reveal him. (<span class="comm">For 
                comment, see pp. 288, 289.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> And turning to the disciples, he said 
            privately, Blessed are the eyes 
            which see the things that ye see.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> for I say unto you, that many 
            prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; 
            and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not. (<span class="comm">For comment, see 
                p. 332.</span>)
