        <h3>71. JESUS IS REJECTED.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 13: 54-58;  MARK 6: 1-6;  LUKE 4: 16-31.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 1</span> And he went out from thence (<span class="comm">from Capernaum</span>)
            ; and he cometh {And coming}  
            into his own country; and his disciples follow him. 




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 16</span> And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up 
            (<span class="comm">As to this city, see pages 14 and 55. As to the early years of Jesus at 
                Nazareth, see page 60</span>):  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 2</span> And when the 
            sabbath was come  he entered, as his custom was, into 
            the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read. (<span class="comm">This does not mean 
                that it had been the custom of Jesus when he was a young man in Nazareth to 
                read in the synagogue. It means that after he entered his public ministry it 
                was his custom to use the synagogue as his place of teaching on the sabbath day 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 1: 39; 3: 1, 2</span></span>). For comment on 
                this usage of the synagogue see pages 172 and 173.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 17</span> And there was 
            delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and 
            found the place (<span class="comm">
                <span class="style7">Isaiah 61: 1, 2</span>; 
                but the quotation embraces other lines from Isaiah.</span>) where it was 
            written, 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he anointed 
            me to preach good tidings to the poor (<span class="comm">Anointing was the method by which 
                prophets, priests, and kings were consecrated or set apart to their several 
                offices. This prophecy says that the Holy Spirit came upon Jesus because he was 
                appointed to do 

                a work of divine helpfulness</span>): He hath 
            sent me to preach release to the captives, And recovering of sight to the 
            blind, To set at liberty them that are bruised, 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> To proclaim the 
            acceptable year of the Lord. (<span class="comm">The prophecy set forth in physical terms what 
                Jesus should perform in both the physical and spiritual realms. The prophecy 
                closes with a reference to the jubilee year, which, being a time of liberation, 
                forgiveness, and fresh starts, was a type of Christ's ministry and kingdom.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant (<span class="comm">This officer 
                corresponded to our sexton. Part of this duty was to take charge of the 
                synagogue rolls</span>), and sat down (<span class="comm">Reader and congregation both 
                stood during the reading; then, usually, both sat down to hear the passage 
                explained. They stood out of reverence for God's word</span>): and the eyes 
            of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. (<span class="comm">They had heard of his 
                miracles, and were curious to see what he would say and do.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> And he began 
            to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which 
            proceeded out of his mouth (<span class="comm">The word grace refers rather to the manner than 
                to the matter. The speech of Jesus flowed easily, and gracefully</span>): 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 54</span> And he taught {began to 
            teach}  them in their {the 
            synagogue}:  insomuch that  
            many hearing him were astonished,  and said, {saying,} Whence hath this man these things?this wisdom, and these might works?  and, 
            What is the wisdom that is given unto this man, and 
            what mean such mighty works wrought by his hands? (<span class="comm">They 
                admitted his marvelous teaching and miraculous works, but were at a loss to 
                account for them because their extreme familiarity with his humanity made it 
                hard for them to believe in his divinity, by which alone his actions would be 
                rightly explained. Twice in the early part of his ministry Jesus had been at 
                Cana, within a few miles of Nazareth, and turning away from it had gone down to 
                Capernaum. He did not call upon his townsmen to believe in him or his divine 
                mission until 

                the evidences were so full that they could not deny 
                them.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 3</span> Is not this the carpenter,  Joseph's 
            son?  the carpenter's son?  the 
            son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon?is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and 
            Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 56</span> And his sisters, are they not 
            all  here with us? (<span class="comm">They brought forth every item 
                of trade and relationship by which they could confirm themselves in their 
                conviction that he was simply a human being like themselves. The question as to 
                his identity, however, suggests that he may have been absent from Nazareth some 
                little time. As to Jesus' kindred, see pages 224-226.</span>)   
            Whence then hath this man all these things? 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">57</span> And they were 
            offended in him. (<span class="comm">His claims were too high for them to admit, and too well 
                accredited for them to despise, so they sought refuge from their perplexity by 
                getting angry at Jesus.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 23</span> And he said unto them, 
            Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever 
            we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country. (<span class="comm">Jesus 
                quoted a familiar proverb, the meaning of which is this: he was part of 
                Nazareth, and hence the claims of Nazareth upon him were superior to those of 
                Capernaum, and therefore Nazareth should have been blessed by his healing. But 
                the expression was evidently used contemptuously, as if they said, "You 
                can do big things at Capernaum, but you can not do them here. You can not 
                deceive us; we know you."</span>)   But {
            And} Jesus said unto them,  Verily I say unto 
            you,  a prophet is not without honor, save in his own 
            country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.  
            No prophet is acceptable in his own country. (<span class="comm">Jealousy forbids the 
                countrymen of a prophet to honor him. Base as this passion is, it is a very 
                common one, and is not easily subdued, even by the best of men. In Nazareth 
                Jesus was no more than the son of a carpenter, and the brother of a certain 
                very common young men and girls, while abroad he was hailed as the prophet of 
                Galilee, mighty in word and deed.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> But of a truth I say unto you 
            (<span class="comm">Jesus 

                now proceeds to make two close applications of the 
                proverb</span>), There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, 
            when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great 
            famine over all the land; 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but 
            only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman (<span class="comm">a Gentile</span>) that 
            was a widow 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of 
            Elisha the prophet: and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the 
            Syrian. (<span class="comm">Naaman also was a Gentile. The first instance cited by Jesus will 
                be found at <span class="style7">1 Kings 17: 8-16</span>
                , and the second at <span class="style7">2 Kings 5: 1-14</span>. Palestine was filled with poor people even in times of 
                plenty, so there must have been large numbers of hungry people during the 
                long-continued period of famine. There has always been a large number of lepers 
                in the land, and surely if any disease ought to prompt a man to lay aside his 
                prejudices that he might obtain healing it was leprosy; but as Nazareth was now 
                rejecting Jesus, so their ancestors had despised the two mighty prophets. Not 
                one of all the hungry would have received bread from Elijah by an act of faith, 
                nor did one of all the lepers ask healing from Elisha.</span>) 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> And they were all 
            filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things (<span class="comm">The 
                Nazarenes were jealous enough of the claims of Jesus when put in their most 
                modest dress; but when Jesus placed himself alongside Elijah and Elisha, and 
                likened his hearers to widows for want, and lepers for uncleanness, they were 
                ready to dash him to pieces</span>); 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> and they rose up, and cast him forth 
            out of the city, and led him (<span class="comm">they evidently had hold of him</span>) unto the 
            brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down 
            headlong. (<span class="comm">Near the eastern end of Nazareth there is a cavern in the rock 
                which forms a precipice down which, if a man were hurled, he would be killed. 
                At the western end there is a perpendicular cliff about forty feet high, with a 
                naked floor of rock at the bottom. To which place they led Jesus we can not 
                decide.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> But he passing through the midst of them 

            went his way. (<span class="comm">A simple statement of a marvelous fact. Miracles are not 
                explained in the Bible.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 5</span> And he could there do 
            no mighty work,  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 58</span> And he did not many 
            mighty works there because of their unbelief.  save 
            that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 6</span> 
            And he marvelled because of their unbelief. (<span class="comm">As to this statement that 
                Jesus felt surprised, see page 273. "It should also be borne in 
                mind," says Canon Cook, "that surprise at the obtuseness and 
                unreasonableness of sin is constantly attributed to God by the prophets." 
                The statement, therefore, is perfectly consonant with the divinity of Jesus.</span>) 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 31</span> And he came down to Capernaum, a city of 
            Galilee. (<span class="comm">We have followed the chronology of Mark, according to which Jesus 
                had already been living in Capernaum for some time. Luke tells of the rejection 
                early in his narrative, and adds this line to show that from the earlier days 
                of his ministry Jesus made Capernaum his headquarters.</span>)
