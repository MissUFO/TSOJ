        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 18</span>   And the disciples of John told him of all these 
            things. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 19</span> And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them unto the Lord (<span class="comm">John had been cast into prison about December, A.D. 27, and it was now after the Passover, possibly in May or June, A.D. 28. Herod Antipas had cast John into prison because John had reproved him for taking his brother's wife. According to Josephus, the place of John's imprisonment and death was the castle of Mach&aelig;rus (<span class="comm">or Makor</span>), east of the Dead Sea (<span class="comm">Ant. 18; 5: 1, 2</span>). It was built by Herod the Great, and was not very far from that part of the Jordan in which John had baptized, so that it is probable that Herod resided in this castle when he went to hear John preach. We learn elsewhere that Herod felt kindly towards John, and this fact, coupled with the statement that John called two of his disciples to him, suggests that John must have been held as an honored prisoner with liberties like those accorded Paul at C&aelig;sarea--<span class="style7">Acts 24: 23</span></span>),  

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 11: 3</span>   and said unto 
            him, {saying,} Art thou he that cometh, or look we 
            for another? (<span class="comm">The prophets spoke of the Messiah as the coming one, and John 
                himself had done likewise--<span class="style7">Matthew 3: 11.</span></span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 20</span>  And when the men were come unto him, they said, John the 
            Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for 
            another? (<span class="comm">This passage has been a puzzle to expositors from the very 
                earliest times. Being unable to understand how the Baptist, being an inspired 
                prophet and favored with visions of the supernatural, 

                could give 
                way to skeptical doubts, they have exhausted their inventive genius to explain 
                what John meant by his question. Among these many explanations the best is that 
                given by Alford, viz.: that John wished to get Jesus to publicly declare 
                himself for the sake of quieting all rumors concerning him, his fault being 
                kindred to that of Jesus' mother when she tried to hasten Jesus' hour at the 
                wedding of Cana (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 2: 4</span></span>). But the 
                plain, unmistakable inference of the text is that John's faith wavered. The 
                Bible does not represent the saints as free from imperfection. It does not say 
                that inspiration is omniscience, or that visions and miracles remove doubts. It 
                took two miracles to persuade Gideon; Moses harbored distrust (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 3, 4.</span></span>), and was guilty of unbelief 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 20: 12</span></span>); Elijah despaired of 
                God's power (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 19: 4-10</span></span>); Jeremiah was slow of belief, and in his despondency cursed the day of his birth (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 20: 7, 14-18</span></span>). But 
                the most instructive parallel is that of Simon Peter. He witnessed the 
                transfiguration of Jesus, beheld the glory of God, and heard the voice of the 
                Father (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 17: 1-6</span></span>); yet he 
                sank below the Baptist, and denied the Lord with cursing; and no man has ever 
                thought it at all incredible that he should do so. The trial of John's faith, 
                though not so clearly depicted as that of Peter, was perhaps equally searching. 
                His wild, free life was now curbed by the irksome tedium of confinement. His 
                expectations were not fulfilled. The unfruitful trees had not been cut down, 
                the grain had not been winnowed, nor the chaff burned, nor should he see any 
                visible tendency toward these results. Moreover, he held no communion with the 
                private life of Jesus, and entered not into the sanctuary of his Lord's 
                thought. We must remember also that his inspiration passed away with the 
                ministry, on account of which it was bestowed, and it was only the man 
                John, and not the prophet, who made the inquiry. The inquiry itself, too, 
                should be noted. It is not, Are you what I declared you to be? but, Being all 
                of that, are you the one who should come, or must we look for 
                another? John no doubt shared with all Jews the idea that Messiah was to 
                set up an earthly kingdom, and seeing in Jesus 

                none of the spirit 
                of such a king, he seems to have questioned whether Jesus was to be the 
                finality, or whether he was to be, like himself, a forerunner, preparing the 
                way for the ultimate Messiah. He did not grasp the thought that Jesus was both 
                Alpha and Omega; that Jesus, the lowly servant of humanity, by service and 
                sacrifice is evermore preparing the way for Jesus the King.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span>   In that hour 
            he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many that were 
            blind he bestowed sight. 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span>   And he  
            Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye 
            hear and see: {have seen and heard;} 


        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 11: 5</span>   the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the 
            lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the 
            poor have good tidings to them. (<span class="comm">John himself, when thus questioned, had 
                answered plainly, saying, "No" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 20, 21</span></span>), and he probably expected a like categorical answer from 
                Jesus. The indirect answer of Jesus, ending with a beatitude, was well 
                calculated to waken in John beneficial thoughtfulness, for it threw his mind 
                back upon the prophecies of God, such as <span class="style7"> Isaiah 30: 5, 6; 42: 7; 41: 1-3</span>, etc. It may be inferred that Jesus 
                withheld answering the messengers and went on with his works of grace, that 
                these might testify to John more potently than mere words of assertion. Jesus 
                did not work miracles to gratify skeptical curiosity, but he did use them, as 
                here, to strengthen wavering faith (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 9: 24; John 11: 15; 14: 11</span></span>); Jesus sums up his work in the form of a 
                climax, wherein preaching the gospel to the poor stands superior even to the 
                raising of the dead. Attention to the poor has always been a distinctive 
                feature of Christianity. To care for the poor is above miracles. Modern 
                Orientals are not impressed by the miracles of the New Testament as such. The 
                sacred literature of India and China abounds in wonders, and with the people of 
                these lands a miracle is little more than a commonplace. With them Christ's 
                love for the lowly is above the miracles. "Wonders and miracles might be 
                counterfeited, but a sympathy with the suffering and helpless, so tender, so 


                laborious, so long continued, was not likely to be simulated. Such 
                humanity was unworldly and divine"--Beecher.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span>   And 
            blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me. (<span class="comm">The 
                scribes had stumbled and failed to believe in Jesus because he did not fulfill 
                their ideal, or come up to their expectations. Jesus seeks to woo John from a 
                like fate by the sweet persuasion of a beatitude. John must realize that it is 
                better for the subject to fall in with the plans of the all-wise King, as he 
                fulfills the predictions of God the Father, than for the King to turn aside and 
                frustrate the plan of the ages to humor the passing whim of a despondent and 
                finite mind.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span>   And when the messengers of John 
            were departed, {<span class="style7">7 </span>And as these went their way,}

            multitudes concerning John (<span class="comm">The commendation of Jesus which follows was not 
                spoken in the presence of John's messengers. It was best that John should not 
                hear it. We also do our work under the silent heavens and wait for the future

            courts. {houses.} (<span class="comm">After the departure of John's 
                messengers Jesus immediately clears the character of John of unjust suspicion. 
                John, who had testified with such confidence as to the office and character of 
                Jesus, now comes with a question betraying a doubtful mind and wavering faith. 
                Was John then a vacillating man? Was he guilty of that lack of steadfastness 
                which the world looks upon as intolerable in all who it esteems great? Was he 
                blown about by every wind of public opinion like the tall reed (<span class="comm">the Arunda 
                    donax</span>) which skirts the Jordan, and which stands, bearing its beautiful 
                blossoming top twelve feet high one moment, only to bow it to earth the next, 
                the slender stem yielding submissively to the passing breeze? Was he a 
                voluptuary about to condescend to flatter Herod and retract 

                his reproof, that he might exchange his prison for a palace? Those who had gone to 
                the wilderness to see John had found no such man, and John was still the John 
                of old. One act does not make a character, one doubt does not unmake it. John 
                was no reed, but was rather, as Lange says, "a cedar half uprooted by the 
                storm."</span>)

            say unto you, and much more than a prophet. (<span class="comm">The next verse shows us that John was a messenger as well as a 
                prophet. Prophets foretold the Messiah, but John was the herald who announce 
                him. John was miraculously born, and was himself the subject of prophecy. Great 
                as was John in popular estimation, that estimation was insufficient.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span>   This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, 
            Who shall prepare thy way before thee. (<span class="comm">This quotation is taken from 
                <span class="style7"> Malachi 3: 1</span>, where it reads "my 
                messenger . . . before me." But Mark (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 1: 2</span></span>) concurs with Matthew and Luke in the reading given here. From the 
                change in the words it appears "that Christ is one with God the Father, 
                and that the coming of Christ is the coming of God"--Hammond.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span>   Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not 
            arisen a greater {there is none greater}than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom 
            of heaven {of God} is greater than he. (<span class="comm">We find 
                from this passage that all true greatness arises from association, relation and 
                contact with Jesus Christ. To be Christ's forerunner is to be above teacher and 
                prophet, Levite and priest, lawgiver and king, and all else that the world 
                estimates as great. If all greatness be thus measured by contact of Christ, how 
                great must Christ be! But the least in the kingdom is greater then John. 
                "This shows: 1. That John was not in the kingdom of God. 2. That, as none 
                greater than John has been born of women, no one had yet entered the kingdom. 
                3. That, therefore, it had not yet been set up; but as John himself, Jesus, and 
                the Twelve under the first commission, preached, was 'at hand'. 

                4. All in the kingdom, even the humble, have a station superior to John's" 
                (<span class="comm">Johnson</span>). Farrar reminds us of the old legal maxim which says, 
                "The least of the greatest is greater than the greatest of the 
                least," which is as much as to say that the smallest diamond is of more 
                precious substance than the largest flint. The least born of the Holy Spirit 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 12, 13 and 3: 5</span></span>) is greater 
                than the greatest born of women. They are greater in station, privilege and 
                knowledge. The dispensations rise like lofty steps, and the lowest that stand 
                upon the New Testament dispensation are lifted above the tallest who rest upon 
                the dispensation of Moses. This is perhaps prophetically suggested by 
                Zechariah--<span class="style7">Zechariah 12: 8.</span></span>)

            baptized with the baptism of John. (<span class="comm">They justified or approved the wisdom

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span>   But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the 
            counsel of God, being not baptized of him. (<span class="comm">The counsel of God was that the 
                nation should be brought to repentance by John, that it might be saved by 
                Jesus; but the Pharisees frustrated this plan so far as they were concerned, by 
                their proud refusal to repent. All who followed their example shared their 
                unhappy success. It is noteworthy that Jesus emphasizes baptism as the test as 
                to whether men justify or reject God's counsel.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 12</span>   From the days of John the Baptist until now (<span class="comm">a period of about three 
                years</span>) the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it 
            by force. (<span class="comm">Jesus here pictures the kingdom of heaven as a besieged city. 
                The city is shut up, but the enemies which surround it storm its walls and try 
                to force an entrance--an apt illustration which many fail to comprehend. 
                The gates of Christ's kingdom were not opened until the day of Pentecost 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 2.</span></span>), but men hearing it was 
                about to be opened sought to enter prematurely, not by the gates which God 
                would open when Simon Peter used the keys (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 16: 19</span></span>), but by such breaches as they themselves sought to make 

                in the walls. Examples of this violence will be seen in the following 
                instances (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 6: 15; Matthew 20: 21; Luke 19: 11, 36-38; 22: 24-30; Acts 1: 6.</span></span>) The people were full 
                of preconceived ideas with regard to the kingdom, and each one sought to hasten 
                and enjoy its pleasures as one who impatiently seizes upon a bud and seeks with 
                his fingers to force it to bloom. The context shows that John the Baptist was 
                even then seeking to force the kingdom.</span>)

            a man gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And 
            wisdom is justified  of all her children.by her works. (<span class="comm">Oriental market-places were open squares where 
                men transacted business and where children held their sports. Jesus here 
                pictures two groups of little ones, one of which wishes to play, the other of 
                which is sullen and intractable. The mirthful group first seeks to play a 
                wedding game. They pipe and dance, but the sullen group sits unmoved. Not 

                disheartened by failure to succeed, the mirthful ones try their hand 
                again and hope for better luck by playing funeral. But this also fails, causing 
                them to lift up their voices in questioning remonstrance. Singular enough, the 
                authorities are about equally divided as to what parties this picture 
                represents. Some say that the dancers and mourners are the Jewish rulers, and 
                that Jesus and John refused to comply with their wishes. The grammatical 
                construction rather favors this view, if we say that "men of this 
                generation" are "like children who call." But such 
                grammatical constructions are not reliable in interpreting Oriental imagery. 
                Jesus means that the men of this generation are like the entire picture 
                presented and does not intend that they shall be taken as the subjects of the 
                leading verbs of the sentence. A parallel instance will be found in twenty-fourth verse Jesus says, "The 
                kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good seed," but in the 
                thirty-seventh verse he says "He 
                that soweth the good seed is the Son of man," thus making the kingdom of 
                heaven like the entire parabolic picture, and not the mere subject of its 
                leading verb. Others say that John came mourning and Jesus came piping, and 
                that the Jews were satisfied with neither. This was the older view, and had not 
                expositors been confused by the grammatical difficulties above mentioned, it 
                would never have been questioned. For the context favors it, and the whole 
                trend of Scripture demands it. It was God in his messengers--his prophets 
                and his Son--who came to set the world right. It was these messengers who 
                took the initiative and who demanded the changes. It was the people who sulked 
                and refused to comply with the divine overtures. The whole tenor of Christ's 
                teaching--the parables of the supper, etc.--represents the Jews as 
                being invited and refusing the invitation. It was John and Jesus who preached 
                repentance, but there was no instance where any called on them to repent. 
                Jerusalem never wept over an intractable Jesus, but Jesus wept over the people 
                of Jerusalem because they "would not." Jesus and John each besought 
                the people to prepare for the kingdom of God, but the people sneered at one 

                as too strict and at the other as too lenient, and would be won by 
                neither. To justify them in rejecting God's counsel, they asserted that John's 
                conduct was demoniacal and that of Jesus was criminal, thus slandering each. 
                But the lives or works of Jesus and John were both directed by the wisdom of 
                God, and all those who were truly wise towards God--children of wisdom 
                (<span class="comm">see <span class="style7"> Luke, verse 29</span>, 
                    above</span>)--justified or approved of God's course in sending such messengers. 
                We should observe that with all the cares of his great mission upon him, the 
                great heart of our Lord took note of the sports of children.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span>  Then began 
            he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because 
            they repented not. (<span class="comm">That is to say, those cities which were especially 
                favored. It does not mean that more miracles were worked in them than in 
                all the other cities; but that more were done in each of these than 
                in any other.</span>)

            Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were 
            done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
            (<span class="comm">Jerome says that Chorazin was two, and Eusebius (<span class="comm">probably through the error of 
                    his transcriber</span>) says it was twelve miles from Capernaum. Its site is 
                identified by the Exploration Fund with the modern Kerazeh, at the northwest 
                end of the lake, two miles from Tell Hum (<span class="comm">Capernaum</span>). Its site is marked by 
                extensive ruins, including the foundations of a synagogue, columns, and walls 
                of buildings. Bethsaida was probably a suburb of Capernaum. We have no record 
                of a miracle wrought at Chorazin, nor of one wrought at Bethsaida either, 
                unless the miracles wrought at Simon's house--see Sec. xxxii, page 170 
                were in Bethsaida. Tyre and Sidon were neighboring Phoenician cities on the 
                Mediterranean coast and were noted for their luxury and impiety. This 
                comparison between the pagan cities on the seacoast and the Galilean cities by 
                the lake no doubt sounded strange to Jesus' disciples, but in the years which 
                followed, Tyre and Sidon received the gospel 

                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 21: 3; 27: 3</span></span>), and Tyre became a 
                Christian city, while Tiberias, just south of Capernaum, became the seat of 
                Jewish Talmudism. Sackcloth was a coarse fabric woven of goat's or camel's 
                hair, and was worn by those who mourned. It was called sackcloth because, being 
                strong and durable, it was used for making the large sacks in which rough 
                articles were carried on the backs of camels. Such sacks are still so used. 
                Ashes were put upon the head and face as additional symbols of grief. Jesus 
                here uses these symbolic words to indicate that these cities would have 
                repented thoroughly.</span>)

            thee. (<span class="comm">Several great truths are taught in this paragraph. We note the 
                following: 1. Every hearer of the gospel is left either much more blessed or 
                much more wretched. 2. That the miracles which Jesus wrought were calculated to 
                lead men to repentance, for they demonstrated his authority to demand that man 
                should repent. 3. That even among those who stand condemned at the judgment 
                there is a difference, and that it shall be more tolerable for some than for 
                others. 4. That God takes account of our opportunities when he comes to measure 
                our guiltiness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 5: 21, 22; 10: 15; Luke 11: 47, 48; John 9: 41; 15: 22-24; Romans 2: 12</span></span>). Capernaum was 
                the most favored spot on earth, for Jesus made it his home. He therefore speaks 
                of it figuratively as being exalted to heaven. Hades means the abode of the 
                dead. It stands in figurative contrast to heaven and indicates that Capernaum 
                shall be brought to utter ruin. Though Jesus was not displeased with the walls 
                and houses, but with those who dwelt in them, yet the uncertain sites of these 
                cities are marked only by ruins, and present to the traveler who searches among 


                rank weeds for their weather-worn stones the tokens of God's 
                displeasure against the people who once dwelt there. In less than thirty years 
                these three cities were destroyed. Sin destroys cities and nations, and 
                permanent temporal prosperity depends upon righteousness. The history of the 
                destruction of Sodom in the time of Abraham is well known. As it was one of 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 13: 22</span></span>) the oldest cities of 
                any great importance in Palestine, this reference to its remaining is the more 
                striking, showing that its destruction did not come from the mere operation of 
                natural law, but as a divine punishment meted upon it for its sins--a 
                punishment which might have been avoided by repentance (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jonah 3: 10</span></span>). There is hope for the greatest sinner if Sodom 
                might thus escape.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span>   At that season (<span class="comm">while these thoughts of judgment 
                were in his mind</span>) Jesus answered (<span class="comm">replying to the thoughts raised by 
                this discouraging situation--this rejection</span>) and said, I thank thee, O 
            Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the 
            wise and understanding (<span class="comm">the selfish and shrewd; the scribes and Pharisees, 
                wise in their own conceit--<span class="style7">John 9: 40, 41</span></span>), and didst reveal them unto babes (<span class="comm">the pure and 
                childlike; the apostles and their fellows who were free from prejudice and 
                bigoted prepossession. God hid and revealed solely by his method of presenting 
                the truth in Christ Jesus. The proud despised him, but the humble received 
                him</span>): 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 11: 6</span>   yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight. 
            (<span class="comm">This is a reiteration of the sentiment just uttered. It means "I thank 
                thee that it pleases thee to do thus." The Son expresses holy 
                acquiescence and adoring satisfaction in the doings of Him who, as Lord of 
                heaven and earth, had right to dispose of all things as it pleased him.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 27</span>   All things have been delivered unto me of my Father (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 3: 35</span>. All things necessary to the full execution of 
                his office as Lord of the kingdom were entrusted to Jesus, but for the present 
                only potentially. The actual investiture of authority did not take place until 
                the glorification of Jesus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 28: 18; Colossians 1: 16-19; Hebrews 1: 8</span></span>). The authority thus delivered shall be 
                eventually returned 

                again--<span class="style7">1 Corinthians 15: 28</span></span>): and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; 
            neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son 
            willeth to reveal him. (<span class="comm">Here again 
                are many important truths taught: 1. While we may have personal knowledge of 
                Jesus, we can not know him completely. His nature is inscrutable. And yet, in 
                direct opposition to our Lord's explicit assertion, creeds have been formed, 
                defining the metaphysical nature of Christ, and enforcing their distinctions on 
                the subject which Jesus expressly declares that no man understands, as 
                necessary conditions of church membership in this world, and of salvation in 
                the world to come. "It would be difficult to find a more audacious and 
                presumptuous violation of the words of Jesus than the Athanasian Creed, with 
                its thrice repeated curses against those who did not receive its 
                doctrines" (<span class="comm">Morison</span>). 2. We can have no correct knowledge of God 
                except through revelation. 3. Jesus begins the revelation of the Father in this 
                world, and completes it in the world to come. 4. By this exclusive claim as to 
                the knowledge of the Father, Jesus asserts his own divinity. 5. Christ's 
                exalted power comes by reason of his exalted being.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span>  Come unto me, all ye

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span>   Take 
            my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye 
            shall find rest unto your souls. 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span>   For my yoke is easy, and my 
            burden is light. (<span class="comm">The preceding remarks are prefatory to this invitation. 
                The dominion which Jesus exercises, the nature which he possess, and the 
                knowledge which he can impart justify him in inviting men to come to him. The 
                labor and the rest here spoken of are primarily those which affect souls. That 
                is, the labor and the heavy burden which sin imposes, and the rest which 
                follows the forgiveness of that sin. Incidentally, however, physical burdens 
                are also made lighter by coming to Jesus, because the soul is made stronger to 
                bear them. The meekness and lowliness of Jesus lend confidence to those whom he 
                invites that no grievous exactions will be made of them. "Taking the 
                yoke" is a symbolic expression. 

                It means, "Submit to 
                me and become my disciple," for the yoke is symbolic of the condition of 
                servitude--see <span class="style7"> Jeremiah 27: 11, 12; Isaiah 9: 4; Acts 15: 10; Galatians 5: 1; 1 Timothy 6: 1.</span></span>)
