        <h3>141. JESUS BEFORE HEROD ANTIPAS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM. EARLY FRIDAY MORNING.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 23: 6-12.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> But when Pilate heard it (<span class="comm">when he heard 
                that Jesus had begun his operations in Galilee</span>), he asked whether the 
            man were a Galilaean. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And when he knew that he was of Herod's 
            jurisdiction (<span class="comm">Herod was tetrarch of Galilee <span class="style7">Luke 3: 1</span></span>), he sent him unto Herod, who himself 
            also (<span class="comm">"also" includes both Pilate and Herod, neither of whom 
                lived at Jerusalem</span>) was at Jerusalem in these days. (<span class="comm">"These 
                days" refers to the passover season. Pilate had come up from his 
                residence at C&aelig;sarea to keep order during the passover, and Herod had 
                come from Tiberias to keep in favor with the Jews by showing his respect to 
                their festival. Hearing that Jesus was a citizen of Herod's province, Pilate 
                saw an opportunity to do two things: first, by sending Jesus to Herod he would 
                either shift or divide the grave responsibility in which he was placed; second, 
                he would show a courtesy to Herod which might help to remove Herod's enmity 
                toward him, a courtesy which perhaps might be the reverse of the discourtesy 
                which likely caused the enmity <span class="style7">Luke 13: 1</span>.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> Now when Herod saw 
            Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, 
            because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. (<span class="comm">As to Herod's previous knowledge of Christ, <span class="style7">Luke 9: 7-9</span>.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> And the chief priests 
            and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. (<span class="comm">The rulers felt that their 
                case had well-nigh failed before Pilate, so they became the more urgent in the 
                presence of Herod, since Herod had less reason to fear them than Pilate. In the 
                midst of this, Jesus stood silent, answering 

                neither question nor 
                accusation. Herod, as sated ruler, adulterer, and murderer, wished Jesus to 
                turn juggler for his amusement; but the Son of God had nothing but silence for 
                such a creature. The only contemptuous word which Jesus is recorded to have 
                spoken had reference to this ruler <span class="style7">Luke 13: 31, 32</span>.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And Herod 
            with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in 
            gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate. (<span class="comm">Herod took vengeance upon the 
                silence of Christ by treating him with abusive contempt. But finding nothing in 
                Jesus worthy of condemnation, he returned him to Pilate.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And Herod and 
            Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at 
            enmity between themselves. (<span class="comm">Thus Pilate gained but half his desire: Herod 
                was now his friend, but the case of Jesus was still on his hands.</span>)
