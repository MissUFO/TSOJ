        <h3>124. DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM FORETOLD.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 24: 1-28;  MARK 13: 1-23;  LUKE 21: 5-24.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> And Jesus went out from the temple (<span class="comm">leaving it 
                to return no more</span>), and was going on his way; and his disciples came 
            to him  as he went forth  to 
            show him the buildings of the temple.  one of his 
            disciples saith unto him, Teacher, behold, what manner of stones and what 
            manner of buildings!  
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 21: 5</span> And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said (<span class="comm">The strength and wealth of the temple roused the admiration of the Galil&aelig;ans. The great stones in its fortifications promised safety from its enemies, and the goodly offerings bespoke the zeal of its friends. According to Josephus, some of the stones were nearly seventy feet in length, twelve feet in height, and eighteen feet in breadth. The same historian tells us of the gifts or offerings which adorned it: crowns, shields, goblets, chain of gold present by Agrippa, and a golden vine with its vast clusters which was the gift of Herod. The temple was built of white limestone, and its beauty and strength made it admired of all nations. It took forty-six years to finish, and ten thousand skilled workmen are said to have been employed in its construction.</span>) {<span class="style5">Mark 13: 2</span> But Jesus answered and said unto them, him,} Seest thou these great buildings? See ye not all these things?</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> As for these things which ye behold, verily I say unto you, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that {which} shall not be thrown down. (<span class="comm">In the very hour when the disciples exulted in the apparent permanency of their glorious temple, Jesus startled them by foretelling its utter destruction, which, within forty years, was fulfilled to the letter. The emperor Vespasian, and his son Titus, after a three years' siege, took Jerusalem and destroyed its temple, A.D. 70. Of the temple proper not a vestige was left standing, but the vast platform upon which it stood, composed partly of natural rock and partly of immense masonry, was for the most part left standing. The destruction of the city and temple, however, was so complete that those who visited it could hardly believe that it had ever been inhabited--Josephus' Wars 7: 1.</span>)</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 13: 3</span> And as he sat on the mount of Olives, over against the temple (<span class="comm">he was in the middle portion of the mountain, for that is the part which is opposite the temple</span>), the disciples Peter and James and John and Andrew (<span class="comm">on this occasion Andrew was in company with the chosen three when they were honored by a special revelation, but is put last as being the least conspicuous of the four</span>) came unto him privately, asked him privately,saying, Teacher,</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> Tell us, when  therefore shall 
            these things be? and what shall be 
            the sign when these things are about to come to pass? {
            to be accomplished?}  and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the 
            end of the world? (<span class="comm">Dismayed by the brief words which Jesus had spoken as he 
                was leaving the temple, these four disciples asked for fuller details. Their 
                question is fourfold. 1. When shall the temple be destroyed? 2. What shall be 
                the signs which precede its destruction? 3. 

                What shall be the sign 
                of Christ's coming? 4. What shall be the sign of the end of the world? Jesus 
                had said nothing of his coming nor of the end of the world; but to these four 
                disciples the destruction of the temple seemed an event of such magnitude that 
                they could not but associate it with the end of all things. Jesus deals with 
                the first two questions in this section, and with the two remaining questions 
                in Section 125.</span>) </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 24: 4</span> And Jesus answered and said {
            began to say} unto them, Take heed that no man lead you 
            {that ye be not led} astray:  
            for many shall come in my name (<span class="comm">claiming my name</span>), saying, I 
            am he;   
            I am the Christ;  and, The time is at hand:and shall lead many astray.  go ye not 
            after them. (<span class="comm">The first sign of approaching destruction would be the 
                appearance of false Christs. These would boldly claim the title, and assert 
                that the time for the setting up of the eternal kingdom had arrived. We have no 
                direct history of the appearance of such persons, the nearest approach to it 
                being the parties mentioned by Josephus (<span class="comm">Antiquities 20: 5. 1; 8. 6, 10; Wars 2: 13. 
                    4, 5.</span>) But as these men left no institutions or followers, it is quite natural 
                that they should be overlooked or dropped by historians. Nothing is more 
                natural, however, than that the excitement attendant upon the ministry of Jesus 
                should encourage many to attempt to become such a Christ as the people wanted. 
                The Gospels show so widespread a desire for a political Christ that the law of 
                demand and supply would be sure to make many such.</span>)</p>   

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And  when  ye shall hear 
            of wars  and tumults,  and 
            rumors of wars; see that ye  be not troubled:
            be not terrified: for these things must first come to 
            pass;  but the end (<span class="comm">the destruction of the temple</span>) 
            is not yet. {immediately.} </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 21: 10</span> Then 
            said he unto them,  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 13: 8</span> 
            For  Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom 
            against kingdom (<span class="comm">Wars and rumours of wars would be the second sign, but 
                Christians in Jerusalem could rest there in safety until a more definite token 
                bid them depart. Of course the wars here mentioned were only such as threatened 
                particularly to affect the Jews, for the trouble coming upon the Jews was the 


                subject of discourse. Alford, in commenting on this paragraph, 
                takes the pains to enumerate three threats of war made against the Jews by as 
                many Roman emperors and three uprisings of Gentiles against Jews in which many 
                thousands of the latter perished</span>);</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> and there shall be great earthquakes, in divers places; and in divers places there shall be famines and pestilences; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven. (<span class="comm">Great natural disturbances would constitute the third sign. That these preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, there is abundant historic evidence. Alford enumerates the earthquakes as follows: 1. A great earthquake in Crete, A.D. 46 or 47. 2. One at Rome when Nero assumed the manly toga, A.D. 51. 3. One at Apam&aelig;a in Phrygia, mentioned by Tacitus, A.D. 53. 4. One at Laodicea in Phrygia, A.D. 60. 5. One in Campania, A.D. 62 or 63. There were an indefinite number of famines referred to by Roman writers, and at least one pestilence during which thirty thousand perished in Rome alone. All these signs are mentioned by unbelieving writers such as Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius, Philostratus, and Seneca, who speak of them because of their importance and not with any reference to the prophecy of Christ.</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 13: 8</span> 
            But all these things are the beginning of travail.  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 21: 12</span> But before all these things, they shall lay their hands on 
            you, and shall persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, 
            bringing you before kings and governors for my name's sake. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 13: 9</span> But take ye heed to yourselves: for 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 24: 9</span> Then shall they deliver you up  to 
            councils;  unto tribulation, and shall kill you:
            and in synagogues shall ye be beaten;  
            and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.  
            and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake, for a 
            testimony unto them.  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 21: 13</span> It shall turn 
            out unto you for a testimony. (<span class="comm">A fourth sign which they needed to heed 
                particularly would be an outbreak of persecution. The Book of Acts furnishes an 
                abundant evidence of the fulfillment of these details. The civil and 
                ecclesiastical authorities 

                (<span class="comm">synagogues and kings</span>) united to 
                oppress the church. See <span class="style7">Acts 4: 3; 5: 18, 40; 7: 59; 8: 3; 12: 1, 2; 14: 19; 16: 19-24; 22: 30; 24: 1; 25: 2, 3</span>. Peter, James the elder and James the younger, and Paul, and 
                doubtless many more of the apostles suffered martyrdom before the destruction 
                of the temple. Tacitus bears testimony to the hatred and blind bigotry of the 
                age when he speaks of Christians as "a class of men hated on account of 
                their crimes" (<span class="comm">Annals, 15: 44</span>). See also Suetonius on Nero 16, and Pliny 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 10: 97</span></span>). For comments on a similar passage see pp. 365, 366.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 13: 10</span> And the gospel must first be preached unto all the 
            nations. (<span class="comm">Paul says that this was done (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Colossians 1: 23</span></span>). Of course the language of both Jesus and Paul must be understood with reference to the geography of the earth as then known. Paul's declaration was written about the year A.D. 63, or seven years before the destruction of Jerusalem. His meaning is not that every creature had actually heard the gospel, but that each had been given an opportunity to hear because the gospel had been so universally preached.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And when they lead you to 
            judgment, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye

            Holy Spirit. (<span class="comm">See p. 318. This is the third time Jesus has given this

                perished during the siege, and ninety-seven thousand were taken captive. Of 
                these latter, many were tortured and slain, being crucified, as he tell us,

                with <span class="style7">Romans 11</span>, we find that the times of the Gentiles signify that period wherein the church is made up of Gentiles to the almost exclusion of the Jews. The same chapter shows that this period is to be followed by one wherein the Jew and the Gentile unite together in proclaiming the gospel. This prophecy, therefore, declares that until this union of the Jew and the Gentile takes place, the city of Jerusalem shall not only be controlled by the Gentiles, but shall be trodden under foot--i. e., oppressed--by them. The history of Jerusalem, to this day, is a striking fulfillment of this prophecy.</span>) </p>

(<span class="comm">Because the flight will be so precipitate that it would necessitate much exposure to the weather, sleeping under the open heaven, etc.</span>) neither on a sabbath (<span class="comm">Jewish tradition limited travel on the Sabbath day to a distance of seven furlongs. The early training of many Christians led them to have scruples about breaking the Sabbath. It is possible that Jesus had these scruples in view, but by no means conclusive, for in fleeing they would need the support and friendship of their Jewish brethren, who would be apt, not only to hinder, but even in those troublous and turbulent days, to show violence to any who openly disregarded the Sabbath. For it must be remembered that the Jews, not being guided by the admonitions of Christ, would regard the sudden flight of the Christians as unnecessarily hasty</span>):</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 21: 21</span> for then {
            those days}  shall be great tribulation,
            such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of 
            the creation {the world}  
            which God created until now, and never, {no, nor 
            ever} shall be. (<span class="comm">These words spoken before the event are strikingly 
                verified by the statements of Josephus written after it. "No other 
                city," says he, "ever suffered miseries, nor did any age, from the 
                beginning of the world, ever breed a generation more fruitful in wickedness 
                that this was." And again: "If the miseries of all mankind from the 
                creation were compared with those which the Jews then suffered, they would 
                appear inferior." The promise that there shall be no days like it of 
                course excludes the terrors and miseries of the judgment day, since it belongs 
                to celestial rather than terrestrial history. Having now the whole paragraph 
                before us, we are ready to discuss the phrase "abomination of 
                desolation" mentioned in <span class="style7">Matthew 24: 15</span> (<span class="comm">p. 624</span>). Taking it in connection with the entire 
                paragraph, we can readily see, 1. That it was a sign practically simultaneous 
                with the compassing of Jerusalem by the Roman army. 2. That it was a clearly 
                marked sign which was to be followed by 

                immediate flight, even if 
                the day of its appearing should chance to be the Sabbath--a flight so 
                sudden that a man must not stop to enter his house or get his coat. Now, some 
                translate the phrase "abomination of desolation" (<span class="comm">or abomination 
                    that causeth desolation, for it may be so translated</span>) as referring to the 
                crimes of the zealots, a faction in Jerusalem, who took possession of the 
                temple and profaned its sanctuary by using it as a fort, thus making themselves 
                an abomination in the eyes of the Jews by polluting God's house and entering 
                where they had no right to enter. But a long interval intervened between this 
                evil deed of theirs and the coming of the Romans, during any day of which a 
                Christian might have taken his departure after the most leisurely manner. 
                Others take the phrase as referring to the entrance of the triumphant Roman 
                army upon the temple courts; but as this was one of the last scenes of the 
                prolonged siege, it could not properly be coupled with the encompassing Roman 
                army. Meyer, aware of this difficulty, takes the position that there were 
                two flights prescribed by Jesus, one from Jerusalem at the time when 
                the Romans appeared, and the other from Jud&aelig;a at the time when the 
                temple fell. But the language used by Luke (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 21: 20, 21</span></span>) forbids us to make the flight from Jud&aelig;a 
                subsequent to the flight from Jerusalem, for both flights were to begin when 
                the Romans appeared. Again it should be noted that the phrase "the holy 
                place" is apt to mislead, especially when coupled with Mark's 
                "where it ought not." The words when seen in English cause us to 
                think of some person or thing polluting the sanctuary of the temple by standing 
                in its holy place. But it is evident that the words do not refer to the temple 
                at all. When the New Testament speaks of the holy place in the temple it styles 
                it en too hagioo (<span class="comm">in the holy</span>), while the words here are en topoo 
                hagioo (<span class="comm">in a place holy</span>). Moreover, after a careful perusal of the LXX. we 
                are persuaded that they used the two terms to distinguish between the holy 
                place in the sanctuary and other holy places, a distinction which the Revised 
                Version recognizes (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 6: 16, 26, 27</span>, 
                    etc.</span>). As none but priests could enter 

                the holy place, it 
                is evident that another is meant at <span class="style7">Psalm 24: 3</span>; but in this place the Septuagint gives us en topoo hagioo. 
                We, therefore, conclude that in this place Matthew uses the term "holy 
                place" to designate the holy territory round about the Holy City, and 
                that the combined expression of Matthew and Mark signifies the investiture of 
                the city by the Roman armies and is equivalent to the plainer statement made by 
                Luke. The Roman armies were fittingly called the abomination of desolation, 
                because, being heathen armies, they were an abomination to the Jews, and 
                because they brought desolation upon the country. The sight of them, therefore, 
                became the appointed sign for Christians to quit the city.</span>) </p>

                had covenanted with the patriarchs that they should be his chosen 
                people, for the Jews are also God's elect (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 11: 28, 29</span></span>). Moreover, it should be noted that there were few, if 
                any, Christians remaining in the city, and that those who were spared were 
                spared as Jews without discrimination.</span>)   </p>
