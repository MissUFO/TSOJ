        <h3>81A. THIRD WITHDRAWAL FROM HEROD'S TERRITORY.</h3>
        <h3>A BLIND MAN HEALED.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">MAGADAN AND BETHSAIDA. PROBABLY SUMMER, A.D. 29.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 15: 39-16: 12;  MARK 8: 10-26.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 10</span> And straightway he entered into the boat with his 
            disciples,  and came into the borders of Magadan.
            into the parts of Dalmanutha. (<span class="comm">It appears from the 
                context that he crossed the lake to the west shore. Commentators, therefore, 
                pretty generally think that Magadan is another form of the name Magdala, and 
                that Dalmanutha was either another name for Magdala, or else a village near 
                it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 16: 1</span> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign and trying him (<span class="comm">testing the strength of his miraculous power</span>) asked him to show them a sign from heaven. (<span class="comm">They rejected his miracles as signs of his Messiahship, the Pharisees holding that such signs could be wrought by Beelzebub. They therefore asked a sign from heaven such as only God could give, and such as he had accorded to Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and Elijah, or such as Joel foretold (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Joel 2: 31</span></span>). It is generally thought that the 

                Herodians were Sadducees of Galilee. If so, we note the beginning of their 
                hostility recorded at <span class="style7">Mark 3: 6</span>, page 216.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 12</span> And he sighed deeply in his spirit (<span class="comm">being grieved deeply at the sinful 
                obduracy which demanded signs in the midst of overwhelming demonstrations of 
                divine power</span>),

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 16: 2</span> He answered and said {saith,} unto them,Why doth this generation seek a sign?  
            When it is evening, ye say, It will be
            fair weather: for the heaven is red.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And in the 
            morning, It will be foul weather 
            to-day: for the sky is red and lowering. Ye know how to discern the face of the 
            heaven; but ye cannot discern 
            the signs of the times. (<span class="comm">For comment on similar language, see page 325. The 
                signs of the times being fulfillments of prophecies, were better evidence of 
                the period and presence of the Messiah than heavenly portents. It is useless to 
                bestow new signs upon those who are blind as to the signs already existing. 
                Jews continue to require a sign--<span class="style7">1 Corinthians 1: 22</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; 
            and  verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be 
            given unto this generation. (<span class="comm">i. e., none such as was demanded</span>) 
            but the sign of Jonah. (<span class="comm">For comment on similar language, 
                see pages 305-306. The resurrection or Jonah sign was a sign from heaven 
                in the sense in which they used the words; that is, it was wrought directly by 
                God, and not through man.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 13</span> And he left them,  And 
            again entering into the boat 
            departed to the other side. (<span class="comm">i. e., from Magdala back again to the 
                east shore, or rather, toward Bethsaida Julias, on the northeast shore.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 16:5</span> And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to 
            take bread.  and they had not in the boat with them 
            more than one loaf. (<span class="comm">This loaf was probably left over from the previous 
                supply.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> Then Jesus said unto them,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 15</span> And he charged them, saying,  
            Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
            Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  
            and the leaven of Herod. (<span class="comm">Leaven, which answered to our modern 
                yeast, was a symbol of a secret, penetrating, pervasive influence, usually of a 
                corrupting nature. The 

                influence of the Pharisees was that of 
                formalism, hypocritical ostentation, and traditionalism; that of the Sadducees 
                was sneering rationalistic unbelief, free thought and cunning worldliness, 
                manifesting itself among the Herodians in political corruption. 16 And they 
                reasoned one with another,  among themselves, saying, 
                We took {have} no bread. They thought that Jesus 
                reproved them for their carelessness in forgetting to take bread, since 
                that carelessness might lead them to be without bread on their journey. So his 
                rebuke below indicates.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 16: 8</span> And Jesus perceiving it 
            said, {saith,} unto them,  O 
            ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no 
            bread?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> Do ye not yet perceive,  neither 
            understand?  neither remember the five loaves of the 
            five thousand, and how many baskets (<span class="comm">cophini, probably traveling 
                baskets</span>) ye took up?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> Neither the seven loaves of the four 
            thousand, and how many baskets (<span class="comm">spurides, probably grain baskets or 
                hampers</span>) ye took up?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> How is it that ye do not perceive that 
            I spake not to you concerning bread?  have ye your 
            hearts hardened?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 18</span> Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear 
            ye not? and do ye not remember?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> When I brake the five loaves 
            among the five thousand, how many baskets (<span class="comm">cophini</span>) full of 
            broken pieces took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And when 
            the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls (<span class="comm">spurides</span>) 
            of broken pieces took ye up? And they say unto him, Seven.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> And 
            he said unto them, Do ye not yet understand?  But 
            beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 16: 12</span> Then 
            understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of 
            the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. (<span class="comm">Jesus had resorted to 
                metaphor because the word leaven better expressed his idea than did the word 
                teaching. The formulated dogmas of the Pharisees were not so bad, but the 
                subtle influence of their spirit and example corrupted 

                without 
                warning, like a concealed grave. There are those to-day who are too skillful to 
                be openly convicted of heterodox statements, but whose teaching, nevertheless, 
                in its very essence and spirit, tends to infidelity.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 8: 22</span> And they cometh unto Bethsaida. (<span class="comm">Not the suburb of Capernaum, but 
                Bethsaida Julias, a town on the east side of the Jordan, near where it flows 
                into the Sea of Galilee. Jesus was proceeding northward toward C&aelig;sarea 
                Philippi.</span>) And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch 
            him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought 
            him out of the village (<span class="comm">Jesus increased the sympathy between himself and 
                the man by separating him from the crowd. Our greatest blessing can only come 
                to us after we have been alone with God</span>); and when he had spit on his 
            eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold them as trees, walking.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Then 
            again he laid his hands again upon his eyes; and he looked steadfastly, and was 
            restored, and saw all things clearly. (<span class="comm">The man's eyes were probably sore, 
                and Jesus made use of saliva to soften and soothe them. But it was our Lord's 
                custom to give variety to the manifestation of his power, sometimes using one 
                apparent auxiliary means, and sometimes another; and also healing instantly or 
                progressively, as he chose, that the people might see that the healing was 
                altogether a matter of his will. The man had evidently not been born blind, 
                else he would not have been able to recognize men or trees by sight, for those 
                not used to employ sight can not by it tell a circle from a square.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> And 
            he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village. 
            (<span class="comm">The man, of course, lived in the village, and to send him home was to send him 
                thither, but he was to go directly home and not spread the news through the 
                town, for if he did the population would be at once drawn to Jesus, thus 
                breaking up the privacy which he sought to maintain.</span>)
