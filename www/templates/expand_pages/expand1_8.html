        <h3>8. SHEPHERDS TOLD OF JESUS BIRTH.</h3>
        <h3>(NEAR BETHLEHEM, B.C. 5.)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 2: 8 - 20.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span>     And there were shepherds in the same country 
            (<span class="comm">they were in the same fields from which David had been called to tend God's 
                Israel, or flock</span>) abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over 
            their flock. (<span class="comm">When the flock is too far from the village to lead it to the 
                fold at night, these shepherds still so abide with it in the field, even in the 
                dead of winter.</span>)  </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span>    And an angel of the Lord stood by them (<span class="comm">He stood upon 
                the earth at their side, and did not float above them in the heavens, as he is 
                usually pictured. His standing upon the earth shows a fuller fellowship and 
                sympathy with men--comp.  <span class="style7">Acts 1: 10 </span></span>), and the glory of the Lord shone round about them (<span class="comm">The Shechinah, or bright cloud, which symbolizes the divine presence (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 24: 16; 1 Kings 8: 10; Isaiah 6: 1 - 3; Romans 9: 4</span></span>). It was seen by the three apostles upon the mount of transfiguration (<span class="comm"><span class="style7"> Matthew 17: 5</span></span>), by Stephen (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 7: 55</span> </span>), and by 
                Paul-- <span class="style7">Acts 22: 6 - 11</span> </span>)
            : and they were sore afraid.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span>    And the angel said unto them, Be 
            not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy (<span class="comm">Christianity 
                is a religion of present joys, and leads onward to joy eternal</span>) which shall 
            be to all the people:  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span>    for there is born to you (<span class="comm">born as a 
                gift to us-- <span class="style7">John 3: 16</span></span>) this 
            day in the city of David a Saviour. (<span class="comm">the angel omits the name of 

                Jesus, but gives the meaning of his name</span>), who is the 
            Christ (<span class="comm">Messiah is the Hebrew and Christ is the Greek for our English word 
                "anointed." Prophets, priests, and kings were anointed. Jesus held 
                all these three offices for all our race for all eternity</span>) the Lord. </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span>     And this is the 
            sign (<span class="comm">The token by which to identify the child. A babe in a manger was not 
                ordinary sight</span>) unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, 
            and lying in a manger. (<span class="comm">"What fearful odds! What a strange contrast! 
                Idolatry on the throne (<span class="comm">in the person of Augustus C&aelig;sar</span>), and the founder 
                of a new religion and a new empire lying in a manger!"</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span>   And 
            suddenly there was with the angel a multitude (<span class="comm">The event was too important 
                to be heralded by any one angel. All heaven was interested in the departure of 
                its Prince, and marveled at the grace of the Father who sent 
                him-- <span class="style7">1 Peter 1: 12</span></span>) of the heavenly host (<span class="comm">God's army (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 22: 19; Psalms 103: 20, 21</span></span>). The Deity is called &quot;God of Sabaoth&quot;; that is, God of hosts or multitude (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 9: 29; James 5: 4; Daniel 7: 10; Revelation 5: 11, 12</span></span>); but at this time God's 
                army appeared to announce the coming of eternal peace</span>) praising God, and 
            saying,towards her 
            (<span class="comm">mercy in granting a child; great mercy in granting so illustrious a child</span>)
            ;   </p>

        <p align="left" clas



           s="style4"><span class="style5">14</span>    Glory to God in the highest (<span class="comm">in the highest 
                heavens-- <span class="style7">Job 16: 19; Ps. 148: 1</span></span>), And on earth peace among men (<span class="comm">The angels invoke blessing on God and peace upon man. Peace between God and man, and ultimately peace between man and man</span>) in whom he is well pleased. (<span class="comm">The love of God is shed abroad upon all, even the vilest of sinners (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 5: 8; 1 Timothy 1: 15</span></span>); but his peace comes upon those who have accepted his Son, and in whom he is therefore especially well pleased (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 9: 11</span></span>). Peace is the unfailing apostolic salutation toward Christians (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 1: 7; 1 Corinthians 1: 3; 2 Corinthians 1: 2, etc.</span></span>), and is attainable in the highest 
                degree by Christians only-- <span class="style7">John 14: 27; 16: 33; Colossians 3: 15; Phillippians 4: 7.</span></span>) </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>    And it came to pass, when 
            the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, 
            Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, 
            which the Lord hath made known 

            unto us.  </p>





        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span>     And 
            they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in the 
            manger.   </p>





        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about the child. (<span class="comm">They were the first evangelists. Among the heralds of Christ we note one great prophet, John the Baptist, and one learned Pharisee, Paul; the rest are shepherds, fishermen, and publicans, yet their gospel has triumphed over the wisdom of men (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 1: 26 - 29; 2 Corinthians 4: 7</span></span>). The 
                shepherds were moved to publish by the same spirit which actuated the lepers at 
                Samaria-- <span class="style7">2 Kings 7: 9.</span></span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span>    
            And all that heard it wondered (<span class="comm">the gospel story excites wonder; the more 
                we ponder it the more wonderful it becomes</span>) at the things which were spoken 
            unto them by the shepherds.  </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span>    But Mary kept all these sayings 
            (<span class="comm">The silence of Mary contrasts with the talkativeness of the shepherds. But is 
                the duty of Christians both to ponder and to publish</span>), pondering them 
            in her heart. (<span class="comm">Only Mary could know the fact here stated; and the statement 
                indicates that Luke got the opening parts of his Gospel from the mother of our 
                Lord. She had much to think about. The angelic messages to Zacharias, to 
                herself, and to the shepherds were full of significance, and her mind would 
                search diligently to comprehend the fullness of their meaning. In her quiet 
                thoughtfulness the beauty of the Virgin's character shines 
                forth-- <span class="style7">1 Peter 3: 4.</span></span>)  </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span>  And 
            the shepherds returned (<span class="comm">they did not make this glorious occasion an excuse 
                for neglecting their humble duties</span>), glorifying (<span class="comm">because of the 
                greatness of that which had been revealed</span>) and praising God (<span class="comm">because of 
                the goodness of that which he revealed</span>) for all the things that they had 
            heard and seen, seen as it was spoken unto them. (<span class="comm">Jesus came in exactly the 
                same manner in which his coming had been spoken of or described by the angels a 
                few hours before; and also just as his coming had been spoken of or described 
                by the prophets centuries and centuries before. God's word holds good for 
                eternity as truly as for one day. The shepherds doubtless passed to their 
                reward during 

                the thirty years which Jesus spent in seclusion prior 
                to his entering upon his ministry. But the rest of their commonplace life was 
                now filled with music of praise, and their night watches lit by the glory of 
                God, which could never entirely fade away.</span>)  </p>
