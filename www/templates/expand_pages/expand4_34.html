        <h3>34. JESUS HEALS A LEPER.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 8: 2-4;  MARK 1: 40-45;  LUKE 5: 12-16.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 5: 12</span>    And it came to pass, while he was in one of the 
            cities (<span class="comm">it was a city of Galilee, but as it was not named, it is idle to 
                conjecture which city it was</span>), behold,  there 
            cometh {came}  to him a 
            leper (<span class="comm">There is much discussion as to what is here meant by leprosy. Two 
                diseases now go by that name; viz., psoriasis and elephantiasis. There are also 
                three varieties of psoriasis, namely, white, black and red. There are also 
                three varieties or modifications of elephantiasis, namely, tubercular, spotted 
                or streaked, and an&aelig;sthetic. Elephantiasis is the leprosy found in modern 
                times in Syria, Greece, Spain, Norway and Africa. Now, since <span class="style7">Leviticus 13.</span>, in determining 

                leprosy, lays great stress on a white or reddish-white depression of the skin, 
                the hairs in which are turned white or yellow, and since it also provides that 
                the leper who is white all over shall be declared clean, and since in the only 
                two cases where lepers are described--<span class="style7">Numbers 12: 10; 2 Kings 5: 27</span>--they are spoken of as "white as 
                snow," scholars have been led to think that the Biblical leprosy was the 
                white form of psoriasis. But the facts hardly warrant us in excluding the other 
                forms of psoriasis, or even elephantiasis; for 1. <span class="style7">Leviticus 13</span> also declares 
                that any bright spot or scale shall be pronounced leprosy, if it be found to 
                spread abroad over the body; and this indefinite language would let in 
                elephantiasis, cancer and many other skin diseases. In fact, the law deals with 
                the initial symptoms rather than with the ultimate phases of the fully 
                developed disease. 2. Elephantiasis was a common disease in our Saviour's time, 
                and has been ever since, and would hardly be called leprosy now, if it had not 
                been popularly so called then. The word "leprosy" comes from 
                "lepo," which means to peel off in scales. It is hereditary 
                for generations, though modern medical authorities hold that it is not 
                contagious. However, the returning Crusaders spread it all over Europe in the 
                tenth and eleventh centuries, so that according to Matthew Paris there was no 
                less than nine thousand hospitals set apart for its victims. The facts that the 
                priests had to handle and examine lepers, and that any one who was white all 
                over with leprosy was declared clean, led scholars to think that the laws of 
                Moses, which forbade any one to approach or touch a leper, were not enacted to 
                prevent the spread of a contagion, but for typical and symbolic purposes. It is 
                thought that God chose the leprosy as the symbol of sin and its consequences, 
                and that the Mosaic legislation was given to carry out this conception. Being 
                the most loathsome and incurable of all diseases, it fitly represents in bodily 
                form the ravages of sin in the soul of a man. But there must also have been a 
                sanitary principle in God's laws, since we still deem it wise to separate 
                lepers, and since other people besides the Hebrews (<span class="comm">as the Persians</span>) prohibited 
                lepers from mingling with other 

                citizens. Elephantiasis is the 
                most awful disease known. The body of its victim disintegrates joint by joint, 
                until the whole frame crumbles to pieces. Psoriasis is milder, but is very 
                distressing. Mead thus describes a case: The "skin was shining as covered 
                with flakes of snow. And as the furfuraceous or bran-like, scales were daily 
                rubbed off, the flesh appeared quick or raw underneath." In addition to 
                the scaly symptoms, the skin becomes hard and cracks open, and from the cracks 
                an ichorous humor oozes. The disease spreads inwardly, and ends in consumption, 
                dropsy, suffocation, and death</span>),  a man full of 
            leprosy (<span class="comm">Some have thought that Luke meant to indicate one so completely 
                covered with leprosy as to be clean (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 13: 12-17</span></span>). But the fact that Jesus sent him to the priest, shows 
                that he was not such a clean leper. Luke meant to describe a leper in the last 
                stages of the disease--a leper past all hope</span>): and when he saw 
            Jesus,  beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and 
            saying to him,  he fell on his face,  
            and worshipped him,  and besought him, 
            saying,  unto him,  Lord 
            (<span class="comm">The Jews, in addressing any distinguished person, usually employed the title 
                "Lord." They were also accustomed to kneel before prophets and 
                kings. It is not likely that the leper knew enough of Jesus to address him as 
                the Son of God. He evidently took Jesus for some great prophet; but he must 
                have had great faith, for he was full of confidence that Jesus had power to 
                heal him, although there was but one case of leper-cleansing in the 
                Scriptures--<span class="style7">2 Kings 5: 1-19; Luke 4: 27</span></span>), if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. (<span class="comm">The 
                leper believed in the power of Jesus, but doubted his willingness to expend it 
                on one so unworthy and so unclean. In temporal matters we can not always be as 
                sure of God's willingness as we can be of his power. We should note that the 
                man asked rather for the blessing of cleanness than for health. To the Jew 
                uncleanness was more horrible than disease. It meant to be an outcast from 
                Israel, and to be classed with swine, dogs and other odious and abhorrent 
                creatures. The leper, therefore, prayed that the Lord would remove his shame 


                and pollution.</span>)   
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 41</span>    And being moved 
            with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him (<span class="comm">Mark 
                habitually notes the feelings, and hence also the gestures of Jesus. It was not 
                an accidental, but an intentional, touch. Popular belief so confused and 
                confounded leprosy with the uncleanness and corruption of sin, as to make the 
                leper feel that Jesus might also compromise his purity if he concerned himself 
                to relieve it. The touch of Jesus, therefore, gave the leper a new conception 
                of divine compassion. It is argued that Jesus, by this touch, was made legally 
                unclean until the evening (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 13: 46; 11: 12</span></span>). But we should note the spirit and purpose of this law. Touch 
                was prohibited because it defiled the person touching, and aided not the person 
                touched. In Jesus' case the reasons for the law were absent, the conditions 
                being reversed. Touching defiled not the toucher, and healed the touched. In 
                all things Jesus touches and shares our human state, but he so shares it that 
                instead of his being defiled by our uncleanness, we are purified by his 
                righteousness. Moreover, Jesus, as a priest after the order of Melchizedek 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 5: 6</span></span>), possessed the priestly 
                right to touch the leper without defilement--<span class="style7">Hebrews 4: 15</span></span>), and saith unto him, {saying,} I will; be thou made clean. (<span class="comm">The Lord's answer is an echo of 
                the man's prayer. The words, "I will," express the high authority 
                of Jesus.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span>   And straightway the {his}  leprosy departed from him, {was cleansed.}  and he was made 
            clean. (<span class="comm">"Luke says, 'departed', giving the merely physical view of 
                the event. Matthew says, 'was cleansed', using ceremonial language. Mark 
                combines the two forms"--Godet.</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span>     And he strictly 
            charged him,  to tell no man (<span class="comm">The language used 
                indicates that Jesus sternly forbade the man to tell what had been done. The 
                man's conduct, present and future, shows that he needed severe speech. In his 
                uncontrollable eagerness to be healed he had overstepped his privileges, for he 
                was not legally permitted to thus enter cities and draw near to people 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 5: 2, 3</span></span>); he was to keep at a 
                distance from them, and covering his mouth, was to cry, "Tame, 

                tame--unclean, unclean" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 13: 45, 46; Luke 17: 12, 13</span></span>). The man evinced a like 
                recklessness in disregarding the command of Jesus</span>):  
            and straightway sent him out,  
            4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; {
            say nothing to any man:} (<span class="comm">Several reasons are suggested why the Lord 
                thus commanded silence: 1. It may have been better for the man not to mention 
                his cure (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 9: 34</span></span>). 2. He required 
                the decision of the priest to make him legally clean; and too much talk might 
                so prejudice the priests as to lead them to refuse to admit his cure. 3. But 
                the best reason is that it accorded with our Lord's general course, which was 
                to suppress excitement, and thus prevent too great crowds from gathering about 
                him and hindering his work. To take this view is to say that Jesus meant to 
                prevent exactly what happened</span>)   but go, and show thyself 
            to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded,
            the things which {the gift that} 
            Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. (<span class="comm">Though healed of his leprosy, 
                the man was not legally clean until declared so by the priest. The priest alone 
                could readmit him to the congregation. The local priest inspected the healed 
                leper, and if he was found clean or cured, he was purified by the use of two 
                birds, cedar wood, scarlet and hyssop, razor and bath. After seven days he was 
                again inspected, and if still cured the priest repaired with him to the temple, 
                where he offered the gift for his cleansing, which was three lambs, with flour 
                and oil; or if the leper was poor, one lamb and two doves or pigeons, with 
                flour and oil (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 14.</span></span>). The 
                healed leper was a testimony that Messiah, the great Physician, had come, and 
                that he respected the law of Moses. This testimony was given both to priests 
                and people.</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> But he went out (<span class="comm">from the presence of Jesus and from the city</span>), and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, {<span class="style5">Luke 5: 15</span> But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him:}. (<span class="comm">The leper was so elated that he could scarcely refrain from publishing his cure, and he must also have thought that this was what Jesus really wanted--that in commanding him not to publish it he did not mean what he said</span>) and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city (<span class="comm">Not a natural or physical inability, but the inability of impropriety. Jesus could not do what he judged not best to do. The excitement cause by such an entry was injurious in several ways: 1. It gave such an emphasis to the miracles of Jesus as to make them overshadow his teaching. 2. It threatened to arouse the jealousy of the government. 3. It rendered the people incapable of calm thought. Two things constantly threatened the ministry of Jesus, namely, impatience in the multitude, and envious malice in the priests and Pharisees. Jesus wished to add to neither of these elements of opposition. Thus the disobedience of the leper interrupted Jesus, and thwarted him in his purpose to visit the villages. Disobedience, no matter how well-meaning, always hinders the work of Christ</span>), 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 5: 16</span>   But he withdrew 
            himself in the deserts, {was without in desert 
            places:} (<span class="comm">That is, the the remote grazing-lands like that desert in which 
                he afterwards fed the five thousand. Such was our Lord's unexampled meekness 
                that he preferred the silent deserts to the applause of multitudes. His 
                meekness was as high above the capacity of a merely human being as were his 
                miracles</span>)   and prayed. (<span class="comm">Luke's gospel is pre-eminently 
                the gospel of prayer and thanksgiving</span>)   and they came to 
            him from every quarter.
