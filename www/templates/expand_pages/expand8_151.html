        <h3>151. SEVENTH APPEARANCE OF JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">SEA OF GALILEE.</span>).</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 21: 1-25.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> After these things Jesus manifested himself again to 
            the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested himself on this wise. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> There was together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in 
            Galilee (<span class="comm">see p. 111</span>), and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. (<span class="comm">As usual, 
                Peter was the leader.</span>) They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went 
            forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing. (<span class="comm">These 
                apostles, thinking that their apostleship had terminated, had returned to their 
                old like as fishermen.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples 
            knew not that it was Jesus.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> Jesus therefore saith unto them, 
            Children, have ye aught to eat? (<span class="comm">Jesus does not use the affectionate 
                teknia--"children," but the familiar and colloquial 
                paidia--"boys." His question was like that of a stranger, 
                or neighbor, who wished to buy fish.</span>) They answered him, No. (<span class="comm">Their 
                brevity bespeaks their disappointment at having a purchaser, but nothing to 
                sell him.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the 
            boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to 
            draw it for the multitude of fishes. (<span class="comm">The movements of large bodies of fish 
                in the waters of Galilee are frequently visible to one standing on the shore. 
                Supposing that the stranger thus saw fish upon the right side of the boat, the 
                disciples readily obeyed his command, without suspecting who it was that gave 
                it.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the 
            Lord. (<span class="comm">Even the wonderful draught of fishes did not at once arouse all the 
                disciples to realize that a miracle had been wrought, and that Christ stood 
                upon the shore. But John, having believed in the resurrection of Jesus even 
                before he had seen the risen Lord, may rightly be presumed to have 
                had a livelier expectation of meeting him in Galilee, and this expectation made 
                him more alert for signs of the Lord's presence. During the night he had 
                probably thought much of that other night when they took nothing, and of the 
                day which followed and on which the Lord filled their nets for them. At any 
                rate, the similarity of the two occasions now flashed through John's mind, and 
                he recognized that it was Christ who had but now bade them cast the net.</span>) So 
            when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (<span class="comm">for he 
                was naked</span>), and cast himself into the sea. (<span class="comm">The arduous task of fishing had 
                caused Peter to lay aside his upper garment; but as he prepares to meet the 
                Lord he puts it on, moved by reverence and respect for the Master, though it 
                encumbered him greatly in his efforts to swim.</span>) 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> But the other disciples 
            came in the little boat (<span class="comm">for they were not far from the land, but about two 
                hundred cubits off</span>), dragging the net full
            of fishes. (<span class="comm">The other disciples restrained their emotions, and 
                attended to the duties of the hour. They were about a hundred yards from the 
                land.</span>) 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, 
            and fish laid thereon, and bread. (<span class="comm">The sight gave a new meaning to the 
                Lord's question in <span class="style7">John 21: 5</span>; he had not 
                come to buy, but to supply.</span>) 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish 
            which ye have now taken.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> Simon Peter therefore went up, and 
            drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and 
            for all there were so many, the net was not rent. (<span class="comm">Peter, being already 
                wet, could lend material assistance in bringing the net to shore. John tells us 
                the exact number of the fishes to show the magnitude of the miracle, both as to 
                the catch and as to the unbroken nets. The latter form a sharp contrast to the 
                broken nets of <span class="style7">Luke 5: 6</span>. Possibly when 
                the hour approached when they would become fishers of men, Jesus meant to show 
                them that a greater and fuller miraculous power would attend and bless their 
                efforts.</span>) 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> Jesus saith unto them, Come and break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. (<span class="comm">It was not, as some suppose, because they stood in a new and special awe of him, that they durst not question him, but it was the nature of the question itself. They feared a mild rebuke like that once administered to Philip--<span class="style7">John 14: 9</span>.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> Jesus cometh, and taketh the 
            bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise. (<span class="comm">Thus he gave to them when 
                he fed the multitude and thus it may be hundreds of times he had given to them 
                when they sat at meat together--<span class="style7">Luke 22: 17-20; John 13: 26</span>.</span>) 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> This is now the third time that 
            Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the 
            dead. (<span class="comm">It was his seventh appearance, but his third appearance to a 
                group of disciples, and the third appearance witnessed by John. John counts 
                as follows: 1. An appearance to the apostles without Thomas; 2. an appearance 
                to them with Thomas; 3. this appearance.</span>) 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> So when they had broken their 
            fast (<span class="comm">after the eating of a meal together had calmed and quieted the 
                excitement of the disciples, and made them susceptible of teaching</span>), 
            Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
            of John, lovest thou me more than these? (<span class="comm">Jesus here means: Do 
                you love me more than these fishes and this fishing business?  He saith unto him, 
                Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> He saith to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto 
            him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my 
            sheep. (<span class="comm">For if you love me (<span class="comm">better than fishing, you are a 
                    fisherman no longer, but a shepherd. 

                    </p>

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of John, lovest 
                        thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou 
                        me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I 
                        love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. (<span class="comm">The Greek here has subtle 
                            shades of meaning which the English does not express. In the first two 
                            questions addressed to Peter our Lord uses the strong verb agapan, and 
                            Peter replies by the weaker verb philein. See p. 519. Peter, as we have 
                            seen, had professed the most unparalleled devotion for the Master, but when the 
                            Lord now asks him if he has that devotion, he humbly describes his love as of a 
                            far weaker order--a mere instinctive affection or strong attachment, but 
                            nothing approaching adoration. In his third question, Jesus drops the 
                            agapan and takes Peter's own word--philein: as if he said, 
                            "Peter, are you even sure that you have a high regard for me?" It 
                            grieved Peter to have the Lord thus apparently doubt that he had even a tender 
                            regard for him, and he appealed to Christ himself as a searcher of hearts to 
                            bear witness that, poor and meager as his love was, it was at least as intense 
                            as he had represented it to be. In response to each of Peter's professions of 
                            love Jesus lays a command on him, as if he had said, "If you love me as 
                            you say, prove it thus." These three commands also contain subtle 
                            linguistic distinctions which, however, are fairly represented by the English. 
                            Lambs and sheep are to be fed, and sheep are to be tended. The former means 
                            that young and old in the church are to be provided for, and, since the word 
                            "tends" mean to be shepherd unto, the latter may mean that Peter is 
                            to play the shepherd to the wandering and the erring, bringing them into the 
                            fold. Before leaving this scene, we should note that it has close relationship 
                            to other incidents in the life of Peter: 1. Jesus here calls him by the name 
                            by which he had first called him, noting the more honorable name 
                            which he had given him. 2. Jesus recalls Peter under circumstances very similar 
                            to his first call. Compare <span class="style7">John 21: 1-14</span> with <span class="style7">Luke 5: 1-11</span>. 3. In a group around a fire of coals Peter 
                            here thrice professes his love for Christ, thus revoking the threefold denial 
                            which he had made under similar circumstances--<span class="style7">Luke 22: 54-62</span>.</span>)
                    </p>

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> Verily, verily, I say unto 
                        thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou 
                        wouldest (<span class="comm">Peter had just shown this freedom by girding himself and plunging 
                            into the sea</span>): but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth 
                        thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest 
                        not. (<span class="comm">Thus our Lord, by delicate but unmistakable suggestion, shows Peter 
                            that the freedom which he now enjoyed would be taken from him, and that he 
                            would lift his hands to permit others to bind him that they might lead him to 
                            martyrdom to which his flesh (<span class="comm">though not his spirit</span>) would go unwillingly.</span>) 

                    </p>

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify 
                        God. (<span class="comm">John, who wrote after Peter's death, tells us what the words of 
                            Christ meant. His words show that tradition is true in saying that Peter 
                            suffered martyrdom, but it is no voucher that tradition is true as to the time 
                            (<span class="comm">about thirty-four years after this</span>), place (<span class="comm">Rome</span>), or manner (<span class="comm">crucified head 
                                downward</span>) of Peter's death. There is certainly no trustworthy evidence that 
                            Peter was ever at Rome.</span>) And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, 
                        Follow me. (<span class="comm">This saying bore the usual double sense in which Jesus employed 
                            it. Peter was to follow him now (<span class="comm">and he did arise and follow</span>), and he was also 
                            to follow Jesus to a violent death and a glorious immortality.</span>)
                    </p>

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> Peter, 
                        turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved (<span class="comm">John</span>) following; who 
                        also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that 
                        betrayeth thee? (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 13: 25</span>.</span>)

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man 
                        do? (<span class="comm">Peter and John were near friends (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 3: 1</span></span>), and understanding that the 
                            Lord had prophesied a 
                            violent death for himself, Peter was naturally interested in the fate of his 
                            dear companion.</span>)

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I 
                        come, what is that to thee? 
                        Follow thou me. (<span class="comm">It was none of Peter's business whether John's earthly lot 
                            was easier or harder than his own; his business was to be faithful in the 
                            pathway whither the Lord led him.</span>) 

                    </p>

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> This saying therefore went forth among 
                        the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, 
                        that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what
                        is that to thee? (<span class="comm">Our Lord's 
                            words were a puzzle when John wrote his Gospel, and to many they are a puzzle 
                            still. For an able treatment of the various interpretations of this difficult 
                            passage, see B. W. Johnson's Commentary on John. There is no question that John died. The site of his grave 
                            at Ephesus was well known to early Christians. The coming of the Lord for which 
                            he tarried was that in the isle of Patmos, of which he tells us in the Book of 
                            Revelation. This passage, therefore, shows that John wrote his Gospel before 
                            his exile in Patmos.</span>)
                    </p>

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> This is the disciple that beareth witness of these 
                        things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true. 

                    </p>

                    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they 
                        should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not 
                        contain the books that should be written. (<span class="comm">Since the "we know" 
                            differs from the "he knoweth" of <span class="style7">John 19: 35</span>, most of the critics hold that this verse was added by the 
                            elders of Ephesus to whom John committed his Gospel, and that it is the 
                            attestation of the church there to the truth and authenticity of the Gospel. 
                            But the first person singular, "I suppose," of <span class="style7">John 21: 25</span> is hard to account for such an 
                            hypothesis. Besides, none of the elders at Ephesus could suppose any such 
                            thing. Only an eye-witness who saw the fullness of our Lord's ministry would be 
                            led to pen these words. We find in the first Epistle of John a condition of 
                            affairs similar to these two verses. The first chapter opens with and continues 
                            to use the editorial plural, 
                            while the second chapter drops in the 
                            first person singular. We think, then, that John finished his own book. 
                            Considering the wilderness of literature which has accumulated around the 
                            sayings and doings of our Lord contained in the brief Gospels, it is little
