                possible that Matthew here refers to the house mentioned at <span class="style7">Mark 3: 19</span>. If so, the events in Sections

                before, this appears to have been the first occasion when he strung them

                paraballo, which means, "I place beside" in order to compare.

                beside an implied spiritual narrative for the purpose of illustrating the
