        <h3>105. THE SANHEDRIN'S DECREE.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM AND EPHRAIM IN JUD&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 11: 47-54</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees 
            gathered a council (<span class="comm">called a meeting of the Sanhedrin</span>), and said, 
            What do we? (<span class="comm">Thus they reproach one another for having done nothing in a 
                present and urgent crisis. As two of their number (<span class="comm">Nicodemus and Joseph of 
                    Arimath&aelig;a</span>) were afterwards in communications with Christians, it was easy 
                for the disciples to find out what occurred on this notable occasion.</span>) for 
            this man doeth many signs. (<span class="comm">They did not deny the miracles, therefore their 
                conduct was the more inexcusable.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> If we let him thus alone, all men will 
            believe on him (<span class="comm">they found that despite the threat of excommunication, 
                Jesus was still winning disciples under the very shadow of Jerusalem</span>): 
            and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation. 
            (<span class="comm">The course of Jesus seemed to undermine Judaism, and to leave it a prey to the 
                innovations of Rome. It is uncertain what is meant by the noun 
                "place." Meyer says it refers to Jerusalem; Luecke to the temple; 
                while Bengel says that place and nation are a proverbial expression, meaning 
                "our all;" but the Greek language furnishes no example of such 
                proverbial use. It is more likely that place refers to their seats in the 
                Sanhedrin, which they would be likely to lose if the influence of Jesus became, 
                as they feared, the dominant power. They 
                feared then that the 
                Romans would, by removing them, take away the last vestige of civil and 
                ecclesiastical authority, and then eventually obliterate the national life.</span>)</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year
            (<span class="comm">that notable, fatal year; he was high priest from A.D. 18 to A.D. 36</span>), said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span> Nor do ye account that it is expedient for 
            you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish 
            not. (<span class="comm">His words are a stinging rebuke, which may be paraphrased thus: 
                "If you had any sense you would not sit there asking, 'What do we?' when 
                there is but one thing to do; viz.: Let Jesus die and save the people." 
                Expediency, not justice, is his law.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span> Now this he said not of himself: 
            but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the 
            nation; </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span> and not for the nation only, but that he might also 
            gather together into one (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galatians 3: 28; Colossians 3: 11</span></span>) the children of God that are scattered abroad. (<span class="comm">The 
                expression "not of himself" is a very common Hebrew idiom for 
                "not of himself only." God had a meaning in his words 
                different from his own. In earlier, better days the high priest had represented 
                the divine headship of the nation, and through him, by means of the Urim and 
                Thummin, the inspired oracles and decisions had been wont to come. This exalted 
                honor had been lost through unworthiness. But now, according to the will of 
                God, the high priest prophesies in spite of himself, as did Balaam and Saul, 
                performing the office without the honor.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">53</span> So from that day forth they 
            took counsel that they might put him to death. (<span class="comm">Thus, acting on the advice 
                of Caiaphas the Sanhedrin condemned Jesus without a hearing and sought means to 
                carry their condemnation to execution. Quieting their consciences by professing 
                to see such political dangers as made it necessary to kill Jesus for the public 
                welfare, they departed utterly from justice, and took the course which brought 
                upon them the very evils which they were professedly seeking to avoid.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">54</span> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed 
            thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called 
            Ephraim, and there he tarried with the disciples. (<span class="comm">Ephraim is supposed to 
                be the city called Ophrah at <span class="style7">Joshua 18: 23</span> and Ephraim at <span class="style7">2 Chronicles 13: 19</span>. Dr. Robinson and others identify it with the village now called 
                et Taiybeh, which is situated on a conical-shaped hill about sixteen miles 
                northeast of Jerusalem and five miles east of Bethel. It is on the borders of a 
                wilderness, and commands an extensive view of the Jordan valley. Here Jesus 
                remained till shortly before his last Passover.</span>)     </p>
