        <h3>144C. THE CRUCIFIXION. <br>THREE HOURS OF DARKNESS.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 27: 45-56;  MARK 15: 33-41; <br>LUKE 23: 44-49;  JOHN 19: 28-30.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 44</span> And it was now about the sixth hour, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 33</span> And </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 45</span> Now  when the sixth hour was come, there was  a darkness came  over allthe whole land  from the sixth hour until the ninth hour.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 45</span> the sun's light failing (<span class="comm">The darkness lasted from noon until three 
                o'clock. It could not have been an eclipse, for the moon was always full on the 
                first day of the passover. Whether the darkness was over the whole world, or 
                simply all of Palestine, is uncertain, as, according to the usage of Bible 
                language, the words would be the same</span>):  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 34</span> And at {about} the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud 
            voice, saying, Eli, Eli {Eloi, Eloi,} lama 
            sabachthani? which is, {that is,} 
            being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken 
            me? (<span class="comm">We can imagine what it would mean to a righteous man to feel that he 
                was forsaken of God. But the more we feel and enjoy the love of another, the 
                greater our sense of loss at being deprived of it. Considering, therefore, the 
                near and dear relationship between the Son and Father, it is evident that we 
                can never know or fathom the depth of anguish which this cry expressed. Suffice 
                it to say, that this was without doubt the most excruciating of all Christ's 
                sufferings, and it, too, was a suffering in our stead. The words of the cry are 
                found at <span class="style7">Psalm 22: 1</span>. Eli is Hebrew, 
                Eloi Aramaic or Syro-Chaldaic for "My God." The former would be 
                used by Jesus if he quoted the Scripture, the latter if he spoke the language 
                of the people.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> And some of them that stood by, {this man} when they heard it, said,  Behold, he {  this man} calleth Elijah.   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 28</span> After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the 
            scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> There was set there a vessel full of vinegar:</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 48</span> And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it 
            with {and filling a sponge full of} vinegar,
            and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.  so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought 
            it to his mouth.  saying,</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> {And the rest said,} Let be; let us see whether Elijah 
            cometh  to take him down.  to 
            save him. (<span class="comm">Jesus had now been upon the cross for six hours, and fever and 
                loss of blood and the strain upon the muscles of his chest had rendered his 
                articulation difficult and indistinct. For this reason some of those who stood 
                by, though perfectly familiar with the language, misunderstood him and thought 
                that he called upon Elijah. Immediately afterwards Jesus speaks of his thirst, 
                and vinegar is given to him to remove the dryness from his throat. Those who 
                give the vinegar and those who stand by, unite in saying "Let be." 
                This phrase has no reference to the vinegar; it is a general expression, 
                meaning, "Let us do nothing to prevent him from calling upon Elijah, or 
                to prevent Elijah from 
                coming."</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 37</span> And </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 30</span> When Jesus therefore had 
            received the vinegar,  Jesus cried again 
            with {uttered} a loud voice,  
            he said, It is finished (<span class="comm">He had come, had ministered, had suffered, and had 
                conquered. There now remained but the simple act of taking possession of the 
                citadel of the grave, and the overthrowing of death. By his righteousness Jesus 
                had triumphed in man's behalf and the mighty task was accomplished</span>):</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 46</span> And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, 
            into thy hands I commend my spirit (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 31: 5</span></span>): and having said this,  he 
            bowed his head, and gave up {yielded up}the ghost.  his spirit. (<span class="comm">None of the 
                Evangelists speaks of Jesus as dying; for he yielded up his spirit 
                voluntarily <span class="style7">John 10: 18.</span></span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 51</span> And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two  in 
            the midst.  from the top to the bottom. (<span class="comm">The veil 
                was the heavy curtain which hung between the holy and the most holy places in 
                the sanctuary. By shutting out from the most holy place all persons except the 
                high priest, who alone was permitted to pass through it, and this only once in 
                the year, it signified that the way into the holiest--that is, into 
                heaven--was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was standing 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 9: 7, 8</span></span>). But the moment that 
                Jesus died, thus making the way manifest, the veil was appropriately rent in 
                twain from top to bottom, disclosing the most holy place to the priests who 
                were at that time offering the evening incense in the holy place.</span>) and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span> and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep 
            were raised; </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">53</span> and coming forth out of the tombs after his 
            resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many. (<span class="comm">The 
                earthquake, the rending of the rocks, and the consequent opening of the graves, 
                occurred at the moment Jesus died, while the resurrection and visible 
                appearance in the city of the bodies of the saints occurred "after his 
                resurrection," for Jesus himself was the "first-born from the 
                dead" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Colossians 1: 18</span></span>). Matthew 
                chooses to mention the last event here because of its association with the 
                rending of 
                the rocks, which opened the rock-hewn sepulchres in 
                which the saints had slept. There has been much speculation as to what became 
                of these risen saints. We have no positive information, but the natural 
                presumption is, that they ascended to heaven. These resurrections were 
                symbolic, showing that the resurrection of Christ is the resurrection of the 
                race <span class="style7">1 Corinthians 15: 22.</span></span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 39</span> And when the centurion, who stood by  
            watching Jesus,  over against him, saw that he 
            so gave up the ghost,  saw the earthquake, and the 
            things that were {what was} done, he glorified God, 
            saying, {he said,}  Certainly 
            this was a righteous man. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 54</span> Now the centurion, and they that were with him feared exceedingly, saying, Truly 
            this  man was the Son of God. (<span class="comm">The conduct of Jesus 
                upon the cross and the disturbances of nature which accompanied his death 
                convinced the centurion that Jesus was a righteous man. But knowing that Jesus 
                claimed to be the Son of God, and this claim was the real cause for which the 
                Jews were crucifying him, he concludes, since he concedes that Jesus is 
                righteous, that he is also all that he professed to be--the Son of God. 
                There is no just reason for minimizing his confession, as though he had said, 
                "A son of the gods;" for he said nothing of that kind, and those 
                err as to the use of Scriptural language who think so. Like the centurions of 
                Capernaum (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 8: 10</span></span>) and 
                C&aelig;sarea (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 10: 1, 2</span></span>), this Roman 
                surpassed in faith those who had better opportunities. But in this faith he was 
                not alone.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 48</span> And all the multitudes that came 
            together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned 
            smiting their breasts. (<span class="comm">The people who had acted under the influence of the 
                priests now yielded to superior influences and began to experience that change 
                of sentiment which led so many to repent and confess Christ at Pentecost.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> And all his acquaintance, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 55</span> And many women  also  
            were there beholding  the women that {who} had followed  with  
            Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  stood 
            afar off,  beholding from afar,  
            seeing these things.  among 
            whom were both Mary 
            Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
            the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 41</span> who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered 
            unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem. (<span class="comm">John 
                has already mentioned this group of women (<span class="comm">see p. 729</span>), and has shown that he 
                stood with them. The women, being unable to bear arms in an insurrection, had 
                little to fear. They were not likely to be complicated in the charges against 
                Jesus. But the men were conspicuously absent. They appear to have stood quite 
                close to the cross at one time just before the darkness. Probably they feared 
                violence in the darkness, and so withdrew and viewed from afar off the scene as 
                lighted by the torches which the Roman soldiers would be obliged to procure in 
                order to effectually guard their prisoner (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">(<span class="comm">Acts 16: 29</span></span>). The synoptists, who make mention of the women toward the 
                    close of the crucifixion, do not mention the mother of Jesus as any longer 
                    among them. It is likely that she had withdrawn with John, being unable longer 
                    to endure the sight. As to the ministering of these women, see p. 297, 298.</span>)</p>
