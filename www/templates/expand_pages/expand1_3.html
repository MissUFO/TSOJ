        <h3>3. ANNOUNCEMENT TO MARY </h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT NAZARETH, B.C. 5.</span>) </h3>
        <h3>LUKE 1: 26-38.</h3>
        <p class="style4">
            <span class="style5">26</span> Now in the sixth month (<span class="comm">this is the passage 
                from which we learn that John was six months older than Jesus</span>) the angel 
            Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth (<span class="comm">Luke 
                alone tells us where Mary lived before the birth of Jesus. That Nazareth was an 
                unimportant town is shown by the fact that it is mentioned nowhere in the Old 
                Testament, nor in the Talmud, nor in Josephus, who mentions two hundred four 
                towns and cities of Galilee. The way in which Luke introduces Galilee and 
                Nazareth shows that he wrote to those unfamiliar with Palestine. Compare the 
                conversation at (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 45, 46</span></span>). Galilee 
                comprised the lands of Zebulun, Naphtali, Issachar and Asher. It was rich in 
                trees and pastures. Its people were hardy and warlike</span>),</p>
        <p class="style4">
            <span class="style5">27</span> to a 
            virgin betrothed to a man (<span class="comm">In the East, the betrothal or engagement was 
                entered into with much ceremony, and usually took place a year before the 
                marriage. It was so sacred that the parties entering into it could not be 
                separated save by a bill of divorcement --</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 
                    1: 19</span></span>) to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David 
            (<span class="comm">that is, Joseph was of the house of David</span>); and the virgin's name 
            was Mary. (<span class="comm">The same as Miriam (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 15: 
                        20</span></span>).
        </p>

        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art 
            highly favored, the Lord is with 
            thee.</p>

        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in 
            her mind what manner of salutation this might be. (<span class="comm">Whether it meant a 
                present sorrow or joy, for God's salutations all mean joy, but 
                usually is in the distant future -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 12: 
                        11; 2 Corinthians 4: 17, 18</span></span>).</p>

        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> And the angel said unto her, Fear not (<span class="comm">the gospel is full of "Fear nots"; it teaches us that 
                perfect love which casts out fear -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 
                        4: 18</span></span>), for thou hast found favour with God.</p>

        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and 
            shalt call his name JESUS. (<span class="comm">The same as Hoshea <span class="style7">Numbers 13: 8</span></span>), Joshua, and Jeshua (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Zechariah 
                    3: 1</span></span>). It means the "salvation of Jehovah." It was one 
            of the most common Jewish names, but was given to Jesus by divine direction 
            because of its fitness -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 1: 21</span></span>).</p>

        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High (<span class="comm">A 
                common Hebrew way of saying "He shall be." Even the evil spirits 
                called Jesus by this name --</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 5: 7</span>
            </span>): and the Lord God shall give unto him [<span class="comm">he shall not receive his 
                kingdom as a bribe from Satan (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 4: 9</span></span>), nor win it by force of arms (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 18: 10, 
                        11, 36; Matthew 26: 53</span></span>), but as the gift of God -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 2: 32‰ 36; Philippians 2: 9‰ 11; Matthew 28: 
                        18</span></span>) the throne (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm. 132: 
                        11</span></span>) of his father David (<span class="comm">this must refer to Mary's descent 
                    from David, for she is expressly told in (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1: 35</span></span>)
                    that her son would have no earthly father</span>):</p>

        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> and he 
            shall reign over the house of Jacob (<span class="comm">That is, over the family or 
                descendants of Jacob; but the expression includes his spiritual, rather than 
                his carnal, descendants (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galations 3: 7, 28, 
                        29</span></span>). This name therefore includes the Gentiles as the name of a 
                river includes the rivers which flow into it forever (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Daniel 2: 44; 7: 13, 14, 27; Micah 4: 7; Psalm. 45: 6; Hebrews 1: 
                        8; Revelation 11: 15</span></span>); and of his kingdom there shall be no 
                end. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah. 7: 9</span></span>). Christ shall 
                resign his mediatorial kingdom to the Father at the close of this dispensation 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians. 15: 24-28</span></span>); but as 
                being one with his Father he shall rule forever.</span>)</p>


        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> And Mary unto the 
            angel, How shall this be (<span class="comm">Her question indicates surprise, not disbelief. 
                Unlike Zacharias, she asked no sign. The youthful village maiden, amid her 
                humble daily duties, shows a more ready faith in the far more startling message 
                than the aged priest in the holy place of the temple in the atmosphere 
                of the sacred incense</span>), seeing I know not a man?</p>


        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon 
            thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow (<span class="comm">the Spirit of God is 
                thus spoken of as "brooding over" or overshadowing creation to 
                develop it -- </span>(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 1: 2</span></span>) thee 
            (<span class="comm">This indicates that the Holy Spirit himself created the body of Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 10: 5</span></span>). The spirit, or divine 
                nature, of Christ was from the beginning, and was unbegotten--that is, in 
                the sense of being created</span>]: wherefore also the holy thing. (<span class="comm">the 
                body of Jesus -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 7: 26; 1 Peter 2: 22</span></span>) which is begotten (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galations 4: 4</span></span>) shall be called the Son of God. (<span class="comm">As the Evangelist is here 
                    talking about the bodily and human nature of Jesus, it is possible that he may 
                    here speak of Jesus as the Son of God in the same sense in which he called Adam 
                    the son of God</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 3: 38 </span></span>) that is, 
                his body and human nature were the direct and miraculous production of the 
                divine power. If so, we find Jesus called the Son of God in three several 
                senses: 1. Here, because he was born into the world in a supernatural manner. 
                2. Elsewhere, because by his resurrection he was begotten from the dead (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 1: 4; Acts 13: 33; Psalm 2: 7</span></span>). 3. 
                Also elsewhere, because of the eternal, immutable, and unparalleled 
                relationship which he sustains to the Father -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 1, 14, 18</span></span>).</p>



        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she 
            also hath conceived a son in her old age. (<span class="comm">The angel tells of Elisabeth's 
                condition, that it may encourage the faith of Mary, and lead her to trust in 
                Him with whom nothing is impossible -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 
                        32: 17, 27; Genesis 18: 14; Matthew 19: 26</span></span>).</p> 



        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> For no word 
            from God shall be void of power. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 55: 
                    11</span></span>). </p>


        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid (<span class="comm">Literally, 
                "slave" or "bondservant." It is the feminine form of 
                the word which Paul so often applies to himself (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 1: 1; Titus 1: 1</span></span>). Mary uses it to indicate her submissive and 
                obedient spirit</span>) of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. (<span class="comm">In 
                great faith she not only believes the promise, but prays for its fulfillment. 
                She bowed to the will of God like 

                Eli</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Samuel 3: 18</span></span>), and became the mother of Him who prayed, 
            "Not my will, but thine, be done"-- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 22: 42</span></span>). And the angel departed from her.</p>
