        <h3>41. JESUS SELECTS TWELVE APOSTLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">NEAR CAPERNAUM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 10: 2-4;  MARK 3: 13-19;  LUKE 6: 12-16.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 12</span> And it came to pass in these days, that he went out 
            into the mountain

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 13</span> And he goeth up 
            into the mountain,  to pray; and he continued all night 
            in prayer to God. (<span class="comm">It was a momentous occasion. He was about to choose 
                those to whom he was to entrust the planting, organizing, and training of that 
                church which was to be the purchase of his own blood. Jesus used such important 
                crises, not as occasions for anxiety and worry, but as fitting times to seek 
                and obtain the Father's grace and blessing.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 13</span> And when it was day, he 
            called his disciples:  and calleth unto him whom he 
            himself would; and they went unto him.  and he chose 
            from them twelve (<span class="comm">We can not think that the number twelve was adopted 
                carelessly. It unquestionably had reference to the twelve tribes of Israel, 
                over whom the apostles were to be tribal judges or viceroys (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 22: 30</span></span>), and we find the tribes and 
                apostles associated together in the structure of the New Jerusalem (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 21: 12-14</span></span>). Moreover, Paul seems 
                to regard the twelve as ministers to the twelve tribes, or to the circumcision, 
                rather than as ministers to the Gentiles or the world in general (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 1: 1; 1 Peter 1: 1</span>. The tribal reference was 
                    doubtless preserved to indicate that the church would be God's new Israel</span>),

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 14</span> And he appointed twelve, that they might 
                    be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 15</span> and 
                    to have authority to cast out demons:  whom also he 
                    named apostles (<span class="comm">The word apostle means "one sent." Its meaning 
                        was kindred to the word ambassador 

                        (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Corinthians 5: 20</span></span>), the messenger whom a king sent to foreign powers, 
                        and also to our modern word missionary, which also means "one 
                        sent." Christ himself was an apostle (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 3: 1</span></span>), and so sent them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 20: 21</span></span>). The word apostle is translated "messenger" at 
                        <span class="style7">2 Corinthians 8: 23 and Philippians 2: 25</span>. The 
                        apostles were to be with Jesus, that they might be taught by his words, and 
                        that they might become teachers of that word and witnesses as to the life and 
                        actions of Jesus. A necessary condition, therefore, to their apostleship was 
                        this seeing of Jesus and the consequent ability to testify as to his actions, 
                        especially as to his resurrection (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 1: 8-21; 1 Corinthians 9: 1; 22: 14-15</span></span>). They could therefore have no successors. 
                        All the apostles were from Galilee save Judas Iscariot</span>):

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 10: 2</span> Now the names of the twelve apostles are 
                    these (<span class="comm">Mark and Luke give the names 
                        of the apostles at the time when they were chosen, but Matthew gives them at 
                        the time when they were sent out</span>): The first, Simon, who is called 
                    Peter,  whom he also named {
                    surnamed} Peter (<span class="comm">For the surnaming of Simon, see <span class="style7">John 1: 41-42</span>. Peter, by reason of his early prominence, is 
                        named first in the four lists. His natural gifts gave him a personal but not an 
                        ecclesiastical pre-eminence over his fellows. As a reward for his being first 
                        to confess Christ, he was honored by being permitted to first use the keys of 
                        the kingdom of heaven; i. e., to preach the first gospel sermon both to 
                        the Jews and Gentiles. But after these two sermons the right of preaching to 
                        the Jews and Gentiles became common to all alike. That Peter had supremacy or 
                        authority over his brethren is nowhere stated by Christ, or claimed by Peter, 
                        or owned by the rest of the twelve. On 

                        the contrary, the statement 
                        of Jesus places the apostles upon a level (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matt. 23: 8-11</span></span>). See also<span class="style7"> Matthew 18: 18; 19: 27-28; 20: 25-27; John 20: 21; Acts 1: 8</span>. And 
                        Peter himself claims no more than an equal position with other officers in the 
                        church (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Peter 5: 1-4</span></span>), and the 
                        apostles in the subsequent history of the church acted with perfect 
                        independence. Paul withstood Peter to his face and (<span class="comm">if we may judge by the 
                            order of naming which is made so much of in the apostolic lists</span>), he ranks 
                        Peter as second in importance to James, the Lord's brother (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 12: 17; 21: 18</span>. Again, James, in summing 
                            up the decree which was to be sent to the church at Antioch, gave no precedence 
                            to Peter, who was then present, but said, "Brethren, hearken unto me . . 
                            . my judgment is"--words which would be invaluable to those who 
                            advocate the supremacy of Peter, if only it had been Peter who spoke them. So 
                            much for the supremacy of Peter, which, even if it could be established, would 
                            still leave the papacy without a good title to its honors, for it would still 
                            have to prove that it was heir to the rights and honors of Peter, which is 
                            something it has never yet done. The papal claim rests not upon facts, but upon 
                            a threefold assumption: 1. That Peter had supreme authority. 2. That he was the 
                            first bishop of Rome. 3. That the peculiar powers and privileges of Peter (<span class="comm">if 
                                he had any</span>) passed at the time of his death from his own person, to which they 
                            belonged, to the chair or office which he vacated</span>);  
                        and Andrew his brother; James the son
                        of Zebedee, and John his brother; {the 
                        brother of James;} and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder
                        (<span class="comm">This selection of brothers suggests that the bonds of nature may strengthen 
                            those of grace. Why James and John were called sons of thunder is not stated, 
                            but it was probably because of their stormy and destructive temper (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 9: 51-56; Mark 9: 38</span></span>). The vigor 
                            of the two brothers is apparent, for it marked James as a fit object for 
                            Herod's spleen (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 12: 2</span></span>), and it 
                            sustained John to extreme old age, for Epiphanius says 

                            that he 
                            died at Ephesus at the age of ninety-four, but Jerome places his age at a 
                            hundred. No change is noted in the nature of James during the brief time which 
                            he survived his Lord. But the gracious and loving character of the aged John 
                            showed the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. But even to the last this son 
                            of thunder muttered in portentous strains against Diotrephes (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">3 John 9-10</span></span>), and his denunciations of sins 
                            and sinners is very forceful, including such epithets as "liar," 
                            "antichrist," "deceiver," "children of the 
                            devil" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 1: 6; 2: 4, 22; 3: 15; 2 John 3-11</span></span>). It is also worthy of note that except in this 
                            verse in Mark, which applies the name "Son of thunder" to John, 
                            neither the word "thunder," nor any of its derivatives is found 
                            anywhere in the New Testament save in the writings of John, by whom it and its 
                            derivatives are used eleven times, a fact which causes Bengel to remark, 
                            "A son of thunder is a fit person for hearing voices of thunder."</span>)

                        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 10:3</span> Philip, and Bartholomew (<span class="comm">as noted on page 
                                111, Bartholomew is usually identified with the man whom John calls Nathanael, 
                                in which case his full name would be Nathanael Bar Tolmai</span>); Thomas, 
                            and Matthew the publican (<span class="comm">Thomas is also called Didymus, the first being 
                                the Aramaic and the second the Greek word for twin. Matthew calls himself the 
                                publican. None of the others apply that term of reproach to him. Matthew 
                                doubtless assumes it in remembrance of the riches of Christ's grace toward 
                                loving him while he was yet a sinner. Exposing the sin of his own past life, he 
                                is silent as to the past lives of the others, not even noting that the first 
                                four were humble "fishermen"</span>); James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 
                            {Judas 
                            the son of James,} (<span class="comm">Matthew's father was also named 
                                Alph&aelig;us, but it was another Alph&aelig;us. This was a very common name. 
                                In its Hebrew form it may be pronounced Alphi or Cleph1: In its Arim&aelig;an 
                                form it is Chalpha1: So in the New Testament we sometimes find it 
                                Alph&aelig;us, and again Cleopas, or Clopas. The apostle James is thought by 
                                some to be our Lord's brother, and by others to be his cousin; 

                                but he is probably neither.
                                This apostle was also called James the Less (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 15: 40</span></span>); probably because he was younger than the son of 
                                Zebedee. He must not be confounded with James the Lord's brother, who, though 
                                called an apostle by Paul, was not one of the twelve apostles (<span class="comm">nor was 
                                    Barnabas--<span class="style7">Acts 14: 14</span></span>). James the 
                                Lord's brother is mentioned at <span class="style7">Matthew 13: 55; 1 Corinthians 15: 5-7; Gal. 1: 19; 2: 9, 12; Acts 15: 6-9 and 21: 18</span> . 

                                He wrote the epistle which bears his name, and his 
                                brother Jude (<span class="comm">who also must not be confounded with Judas Thadd&aelig;us, the 
                                    apostle</span>) wrote the epistle which bears his name. We do not know the James who 
                                was the father of Judas, and of Judas himself we know very little. He seems to 
                                have been known at first by his name Thadd&aelig;us, possibly to distinguish 
                                him from Iscariot, but later (<span class="comm">for Luke and John wrote later than Matthew and 
                                    Mark</span>) by the name Judas--<span class="style7">John 14: 22</span>.</span>)

                        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 10:4</span> Simon the Cananaean,  who was called the Zealot (<span class="comm">Canan&aelig;an means the same as 
                                zealot. It comes from the Hebrew word kana, which means zealous. The Zealots 
                                were a sect or order of men much like our modern "Regulators," or 
                                "Black Caps." They were zealous for the Jewish law, and citing 
                                Phinehas (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 25: 7-8</span></span>) and Elijah 
                                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 18: 40</span></span>) as their 
                                examples, they took justice in their own hands and punished offenders much 
                                after the manner lynchers. It is thought that they derived their name from the 
                                dying charge of the Asmon&aelig;an Mattathias when he said, "Be ye 
                                zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your 
                                fathers" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Maccabees 2: 50</span></span>). Whatever they were at first, it is certain 
                                that their later course was marked by frightful excesses, and they are charged 
                                with having been the human instrument which brought about the destruction of 
                                Jerusalem. See Josephus, Wars, 4, 3: 9, 5: 1-4; 6: 3; 7, 8: 1. 
                                Simon is the least known of all the apostles, being nowhere individually 
                                mentioned outside the catalogues</span>),  and Judas 
                            Iscariot,  who became a traitor;  
                            who also betrayed him. (<span class="comm">Judas is named last in all the three lists, and 
                                the same note of infamy attaches to him in each case. He is omitted from the 
                                list in Acts, for he was then dead. As he was treasurer of the apostolic group, 
                                he was probably chosen for office because of his executive ability. He was 
                                called Iscariot from his native city Kerioth, which pertained to 
                                Judah--<span class="style7">Joshua 15: 25</span>.</span>)
