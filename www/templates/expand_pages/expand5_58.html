        <h3>58. JOURNEYING ABOUT GALILEE.</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 8: 1-3.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span>   And it came to pass soon afterwards (<span class="comm">
                i. e.,. soon after his visit to the Pharisee</span>), that he went about 
            through cities and villages (<span class="comm">thus making a thorough circuit of the region 
                of Galilee</span>), preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom 
            of God (<span class="comm">John had preached repentance as a preparation for the kingdom; but 
                Jesus now appears to have preached the kingdom itself, which was indeed to 
                bring good tidings--<span class="style7">Romans 14: 17</span>
            </span>), and with him the twelve (<span class="comm">We here get a glimpse of the tireless 
                activities of the ministry of Christ. Journeying from place to place, he was 
                constantly preaching the gospel publicly to the people, and as ceaselessly 
                instructing his disciples privately. The twelve 

                were now serving 
                an apprenticeship in that work on which he would soon send them forth alone. 
                From this time forth we can hardly look upon Capernaum as the home of Jesus. 
                From now to the end of his ministry his life was a wandering journey, and he 
                and his apostles sustained by the offerings of friends. The circuit of Galilee 
                here mentioned is peculiar to Luke</span>), 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span>   and certain women who had been 
            healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from 
            whom seven demons had gone out (<span class="comm">What a change of service, from demoniac 
                bondage to the freedom of Christ!</span>), 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span>   and Joanna the wife of Chuzas 
            Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them of 
            their substance. (<span class="comm">As to the vile slanders with which commentators have 
                stained the good name of Mary Magdalene, see p. 291. For further mention of 
                her, see <span class="style7"> John 19: 25; Mark 15: 47; 16: 1, 9 John 20: 11-18</span>. Mary's name indicates that she was a native of 
                Magdala (<span class="comm">Hebrew, Migdol, i. e., watch-tower</span>). Of all the towns which 
                dotted the shores of Galilee in Christ's day, but this and Tiberias remain. It 
                is on the west shore of the lake, at the southeast corner of the plain of 
                Gennesaret, and is to-day a small collection of mud hovels. It still bears the 
                name el-Mejdel, which is probably received from the adjoining 
                watch-tower that guarded the entrance to the plain, the ruins of which are 
                still to be seen. We should note that Mary Magdalene is not classed with 
                restored profligates, but with those who were healed of infirmities. Joanna is 
                mentioned again at <span class="style7"> Luke 24: 10</span>; of 
                Susanna there is no other record, this being enough to immortalize her. Of 
                Chuzas we know nothing more than what is stated here. There are two Greek words 
                for steward, epitropos and oikonomos. The first may be translated 
                administrator, superintendent or governor. It conveys the impression of an 
                officer of high rank. The Jewish rabbis called Obadiah the epitropos of 
                Ahab. This was the office held by Chuzas, and its translated treasurer 
                in the Arabic version. The second word may be translated housekeeper, or 
                domestic manager. It was an office usually held by some 

                trusted 
                slave as a reward for his fidelity. Chuzas was no doubt a man of means and 
                influence. As there was no order of nobility in Galilee, and as such an officer 
                might be nevertheless styled a nobleman, this Chuzas was very likely the 
                nobleman of <span class="style7"> John 4: 46</span>. If so, the 
                second miracle at Cana explains the devotion of Joanna to Jesus. Herod's 
                capital was at Sephoris, on an elevated tableland not far from Capernaum. The 
                ministration of these women shows the poverty of Christ and his apostles, and 
                explains how they were able to give themselves so unremittingly to the work. 
                Some of the apostles also may have had means enough to contribute somewhat to 
                the support of the company, but in any event the support was meager enough, for 
                Jesus was among the poorest of earth (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 9: 58; Matt. 17: 24; 2 Corinthians 8: 9</span></span>). His reaping of carnal things was 
                as scanty as his sowing of spiritual things was abundant (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 9: 11</span></span>). We should note how Jesus began 
                to remove the fetters of custom which bound women, and to bring about a 
                condition of universal freedom (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galatians 3: 28</span></span>).</span>)
