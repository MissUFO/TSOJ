        <h3>96. JESUS THE GUEST OF MARTHA AND MARY.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">BETHANY, NEAR JERUSALEM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 10: 38-42.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> Now as they went on their way (<span class="comm">he was 
                journeying through Jud&aelig;a, attended by the twelve</span>), he entered 
            into a certain village (<span class="comm">It was the village of Bethany (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 11: 1</span></span>), which was on the eastern slope of 
                the Mount of Olives, less than two miles from Jerusalem</span>): and a 
            certain woman named Martha received him into her house.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> And she 
            had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord's feet, and heard his 
            word. (<span class="comm">Sitting at the feet was the ancient posture of pupils (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 22: 3</span></span>). Martha honored Christ as a 
                Guest, but Mary honored him as a Teacher.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> But Martha was cumbered 
            about much serving (<span class="comm">she was evidently preparing an elaborate repast, and 
                was experiencing the worry and distraction which usually accompanies such 
                effort</span>); and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care 
            that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help 
            me. (<span class="comm">Martha so forms her appeal to Christ as to make it a covert 
                insinuation that Mary would not listen to her requests.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> And Jesus 
            answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about 
            many things (<span class="comm">By thus repeating the name, Jesus tempered the rebuke. See 
                also <span class="style7">Luke 22: 31; Acts 9: 4</span></span>):

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> but one thing is needful (<span class="comm">I.e., one duty or privilege is 
                pre-eminent. Bread for the body may be important, but food for the soul is, 
                after all, the one thing needful</span>): for Mary hath chosen that good 
            part, which shall not be taken away from her. (<span class="comm">The expression "good 
                part" is an allusion to the portion of honor sent to the principal guest 
                at a banquet. Its use shows that Jesus had food in mind when he used the 

                expression "one thing is needful," and that he was 
                contrasting spiritual nourishment with physical. The description of the two 
                sisters here tallies with that given at <span class="style7">John 12: 2-3</span>, for there Martha serves and Mary expresses personal devotion. 
                Our Lord's rebuke is not aimed at hospitality, nor at a life full of energy and 
                business. It is intended to reprove that fussy fretfulness which attempts many 
                unneeded things, and ends in worry and fault-finding. It does not set a life of 
                religious contemplation above a life of true religious activity, for 
                contemplation is here contrasted with activity put forth with a faulty spirit. 
                The trend of the New Testament teaching shows that a man must be a doer 
                as well as a hearer of the Word.</span>)
