        <h3>143. SUICIDE OF JUDAS</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE TEMPLE AND OUTSIDE THE </span><br>
            <span class="style4">WALL OF JERUSALEM. FRIDAY MORNING.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 27: 3-10;  ACTS 1: 18, 19</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">3</span> Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw 
            that he was condemned (<span class="comm">Judas, having no reason to fear the enemies of 
                Jesus, probably stood in their midst and witnessed the entire trial</span>), 
            repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief 
            priests and elders, </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed 
            innocent blood. (<span class="comm">There are two Greek words which are 
                translated "repented," the one properly so translated, 
                metanoeo, which means literally "to know after" and which 
                therefore means a change of mind or purpose; and the other, metamellomai,
                which is used here and which means literally "to care after," 
                indicates a sorrow for the past. The first should be translated 
                "repent;" the second, "regret." Trench draws the 
                distinction thus: "He who has changed his mind about the past is 
                in the way to change everything; he who has an after care may have 
                little or nothing more than a selfish dread of the consequences of what he has 
                done." Considering the prophecy which had been uttered with regard to 
                Judas' act (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 26: 24</span></span>), he had 
                good reason to fear the consequences. While he testifies as to the innocence of 
                Jesus, he expresses no affection for him.</span>) But they said, What is that to 
            us? see thou to it. (<span class="comm">The rulers 
                did not share with Judas the wish to undo what had been done. They have been 
                censured for not receiving the testimony which Judas gave as to the innocence 
                of Jesus. But as they condemned Jesus upon his own testimony, any evidence 
                which Judas might give would be, from their standpoint, irrelevant and 
                immaterial. Could Judas testify that Jesus was indeed the Son of God? If our 
                Lord's own testimony to this effect was regarded as blasphemy, nothing which 
                Judas could say would change the case. But the testimony of Judas, in the free, 
                untechnical court of public opinion, is of vast weight and importance. It shows 
                that one who had every opportunity of knowing Jesus, and who was sordid enough 
                to betray him, was yet forced for conscience' sake to admit that there was no 
                reason why he should have done so.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And he cast down the pieces of silver 
            into the sanctuary, and departed (<span class="comm">Judas found the chief priests in the 
                sanctuary. Having obtained from Pilate the condemnation of Jesus, they hastened 
                back to the temple to discharge their morning duties. This gave the soldiers 
                time to mock Jesus, and Pilate time to order and prepare the crucifixion. And 
                so, though Jesus was sentenced at six o'clock in the morning (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 19: 14</span></span>), he was not crucified 
                until the third hour, or nine o'clock (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 15: 25</span></span>). Thus the priests were enabled to be present at the crucifixion, 
                or at least very soon after the crosses were erected. Judas, finding that they 
                would not receive his money, cast it down before them that his hands might be 
                no longer burnt by holding it</span>); and he went away and hanged 
            himself. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span>  And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and 
            said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of 
            blood. (<span class="comm">The law of God made no provision as to the uses of blood money; it 
                was the tradition of the elders which thus forbade to put it into the treasury. 
                Theirs was a strange conscience indeed, which could take out the Lord's money 
                (<span class="comm">and, under the then existing Jewish theocratic government, all public money 
                    was the Lord's money</span>) and spend it for blood, but when it was so spent they 
                could not put it back! Moreover, theirs was a strange admission. If the money 
                given to Judas was properly expended for the arrest of a real criminal, it was 
                justice money, and not blood money at all.</span>)
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And they took counsel, and 
            bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. (<span class="comm">That is, the 
                foreigners who died in Jerusalem. Whether rich or poor, they were not wanted in 
                Jewish graveyards. The potter's field, being excavated for clay, would be of 
                little value, and would sell cheap.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> Wherefore that field was called, the 
            field of blood, unto this day. (<span class="comm">This mark of time shows that Matthew's 
                Gospel was written a good many years after the crucifixion.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> Then was 
            fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they 
            took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom
            certain of the children of Israel 
            did price; </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> and they gave them for the potter's field, as the 
            Lord appointed me. (<span class="comm">This quotation is not found in any writings of Jeremiah 
                which we have, and as there are no other indications of lost writings of that 
                prophet, it is reasonable to suppose that Matthew refers to <span class="style7">Zechariah 11: 12, 13</span>; and that early transcribers 
                miscopied the name, which, in the Greek, could be done by changing only two 
                letters; viz.: i for 

                z and m for r. The prophecy is one of the 
                third class described on p. 51.</span>)  
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> (<span class="comm">Now this man 
                obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he 
                burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And 
            it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their 
            language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.</span>) 
            (<span class="comm">This parenthesis contains the words of Luke inserted in the midst of a speech 
                made by Simon Peter to explain the meaning of his words. His account of Judas' 
                death varies in three points from that given by Matthew, but the variations are 
                easily harmonized. 1. Evidently Judas hung until his abdomen was partially 
                decomposed; then his neck giving way, the rope breaking, or something happening 
                which caused his body to fall, it burst open when it struck the ground. 2. 
                Judas is spoken of as purchasing the field, and so he did, for the priests 
                bought it with his money, so that legally it was his purchase. 3. The field was 
                called "The field of blood" for two reasons, and each Evangelist 
                gives one of them.</span>)</p>
