        <h3>18. JESUS' FIRST DISCIPLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">BETHANY BEYOND JORDAN, SPRING A.D. 27.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 1: 35-51.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> Again on the morrow (<span class="comm">John's direct testimony 
                bore fruit on the second day</span>) John was standing, and two of his disciples
            (<span class="comm">An audience of two. A small field; but a large harvest</span>); 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> and he 
            looked (<span class="comm">Gazed intently. The word is used at<span class="style7"> Mark 14: 67; Luke 22: 61 Mark 10: 21-27</span>. John looked searchingly 
                at that face, which, so far as any record shows, he was never to see on earth 
                again. The more intently we look upon Jesus, the more powerfully we proclaim 
                him</span>) upon Jesus as he walked (<span class="comm">This detail seems to be introduced to show 
                that the Baptist did not stop Jesus and enter into familiar conversation with 
                him. The witness of John was wholly that of an inspired, unbiased prophet, and 
                not that of a friend or a familiar acquaintance</span>), and saith, Behold 
            the Lamb of God! (<span class="comm">John repeats this testimony. He might have chosen another 
                message, but preferred this one. Paul also had but one theme--<span class="style7">1 Corinthians 2: 2; Galatians 6: 14</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And the two 
            disciples (<span class="comm">Andrew and probably John, the writer of this Gospel. The 
                following are indications that it was John: 1. From this time on he speaks as 
                an eye-witness. 2. We have no other account in his Gospel on his call to 
                discipleship. 3. On seven other occasions in this Gospel he withholds his 
                name--<span class="style7">John 13: 23; 19: 26-35; 20: 2; 
                    21: 7, 20, 24</span></span>) heard him speak, they followed Jesus. (<span class="comm">Here 
                is the fountainhead of Christianity, for Christianity is following Jesus.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek 
            ye? (<span class="comm">They doubtless felt such awe and reverence for the person of Jesus as 
                would make them hesitate to address him. Hence Jesus himself opens the way for 
                intercourse with himself.</span>) And they said unto him, Rabbi (<span class="comm">which is to say, 
                being interpreted, Teacher</span>) 

            (<span class="comm">By the way in which John explains 
                Jewish words and customs, it becomes apparent that his Gospel was written for 
                Gentiles as well as for Jews. Some take these explanations as evidence that 
                John's Gospel was written after the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem. 
                They are indeed a slight evidence of this, for it is more expedient to explain 
                a custom which has ceased to exist than one which survives to explain itself</span>)
            , where abidest thou?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> He saith, Come, and ye shall 
            see. (<span class="comm">The fitting invitation of him who says: "Seek, and ye shall 
                find."</span>) They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode 
            with him that day: it was about the tenth hour. (<span class="comm">It being a crisis in his 
                life, John remembered the very hour. If John reckoned time according to the 
                Jewish method, it was about 4 P. M. If according to the Roman method, it was 10 
                A. M. We are inclined to accept the latter as correct.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> One of the two 
            that heard John speak, and 
            followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> He findeth 
            first (<span class="comm">before he did anything else</span>) his own brother Simon (<span class="comm">The word 
                "own" is here coupled with "brother" to show that Simon 
                was not a mere relative (<span class="comm">as the word "brother" might mean</span>), but it 
                was literally Andrew's brother</span>) and saith unto him, We have found the 
            Messiah (<span class="comm">which is, being interpreted, Christ</span>). (<span class="comm">"Messiah" is 
                Hebrew, "Christ" is Greek, "Anointed" is English. Jesus 
                is the anointed of God. In finding him, Andrew had made the greatest discovery 
                which it is possible for a man to make.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> He brought him unto Jesus. 
            (<span class="comm">Thus Andrew has in a sense the honor of being the first Christian evangelist.</span>) 
            Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon (<span class="comm">this name means 
                "hearing"</span>) the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (<span class="comm">which 
                is by interpretation, Peter</span>). (<span class="comm">Cephas is Hebrew, Peter is Greek, stone is 
                English. It means a mass of rock detached from the bed-rock or strata on which 
                the earth rests. The future tense, "thou shalt be," indicates that 
                Peter was to win his name. It is given prophetically to describe the stability 
                to which the then weak and vacillating Simon should attain.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span> On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip 
            (<span class="comm">In the synoptists, Philip is a mere name in the apostolic list. Through John 
                we gain some acquaintance with him--<span class="style7">John 6: 5; 
                    12: 21; 14: 8</span></span>): and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me. 
            (<span class="comm">The Lord's usual invitation to discipleship--<span class="style7">Matthew 8: 22; 9: 9; 19: 21; Mark 2: 14; 10: 21; Luke 5: 27; 9: 59; John 
                    21: 19</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> Now Philip was from Bethsaida (<span class="comm">Bethsaida of 
                Galilee, on the northwestern shore of the Lake of Galilee. It was a wicked 
                place--<span class="style7">Matt. 11: 21</span></span>), of 
            the city of Andrew and Peter. (<span class="comm">It appears that Peter afterward removed to 
                Capernaum--<span class="style7">Mark 1: 29</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> Philip findeth Nathanael (<span class="comm">Nathanael is 
                commonly identified with Bartholomew for the following reasons: 1. The name 
                Bartholomew is only a patronymic, and hence its bearer would be likely to have 
                an additional name. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Compare Matthew 16: 17; Acts 
                        4: 36</span>.</span>) 2. John never mentions Bartholomew, and the Synoptists 
                never mention Nathanael, though John mentions him among apostles at the 
                beginning and at the close of Christ's ministry. 3. The Synoptists, in their 
                list of apostles, invariably place Philip next to Bartholomew, and show a 
                tendency to place brothers and friends together. 4. All the other disciples 
                mentioned in this chapter become apostles, and none are so highly commended as 
                Nathanael. 5. Bartholomew is connected with Matthew in the list at <span class="style7">Acts 1: 13</span>, and the names Matthew and Nathanael 
                both mean the same, and are equal to the Greek name Theodore, which means 
                "gift of God." But even so the identification is not perfect</span>)
            , and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and 
            the prophets, wrote (<span class="comm">The whole law is full of symbolism which refers to 
                Christ. The following references may be taken as more specific: <span class="style7">Genesis 49: 10; Numbers 24: 17-19; Deuteronomy 18: 
                    15</span>. The passages in the prophets are too numerous to mention. For 
                samples see <span class="style7">Isaiah 7: 14; 9: 6; 52: 13; 53: 
                    1-12; Ezekiel 34: 23-31</span>. In brief, Moses wrote of him 
                as a Prophet, David as Lord, Isaiah as the Son of the virgin and suffering 
                Servant, Jeremiah as the 

                Branch, Ezekiel as the Shepherd, Malachi 
                as the Messenger of the Covenant, Daniel as the Messiah. Christ is the hero and 
                subject-matter of both Testaments--<span class="style7">1 Peter 1: 
                    11; John 5: 39</span></span>), Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
            (<span class="comm">Philip knew no better at this time, and John did not change the words of 
                Philip to suit his later knowledge of Christ's parentage. John has already 
                declared the divine origin of Jesus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1:14</span></span>), thereby agreeing with the detailed account of Matthew and 
                Luke.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of 
            Nazareth? (<span class="comm">Because of their want of culture, their rude dialect, and their 
                contact with Gentiles, the Galileans were lightly esteemed by the inhabitants 
                of Jud&aelig;a (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 7: 52</span></span>). But here 
                Nathanael, a Galilean himself, speaks slightingly of Nazareth. Some think that 
                Nazareth was no worse than the rest of Galilee, and that Nathanael speaks thus 
                disparagingly because he dwelt in the neighboring town of Cana, and felt that 
                jealousy which often exists between rival villages. The guileless Nathanael had 
                no such jealousy, and the persistency with which the enemies of Jesus called 
                him the Nazarene indicates that there was more than a local odium attached to 
                the name Nazareth. Moreover, it was the first city to offer violence to Christ 
                and was ready on one day's acquaintance with his preaching to put him to 
                death.</span>) Philip saith to him, Come and see. (<span class="comm">So said afterward the woman 
                of Samaria (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 4: 29</span></span>). Investigation 
                removes prejudice.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, 
            Behold an Israelite indeed (<span class="comm">An Israelite in spirit as well as in flesh 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 2: 28-29; 9: 16</span></span>). Such a 
                character contrasted sharply with the prevalent formalism and hypocrisy of that 
                day</span>), in whom is no guile! (<span class="comm">Some see in the word guile a 
                reference to Jacob. He was a man full of all subtlety and guile in his early 
                years, but his experience at Peniel (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 
                        32: 22-31</span></span>) changed his nature and his name, and he became 
                Israel, the spiritual father of all true Israelites.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> Nathanael saith 
            unto him, Whence knowest thou me? (<span class="comm">Nathanael's surprise clearly indicates 
                that the knowledge 

                which Jesus exhibited was miraculous. Jesus 
                answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast 
                under the fig tree, I saw thee. (<span class="comm">The fig-tree affords the densest shade in 
                    Palestine--a shade where no sunspot can be seen. This fact has made it 
                    immemorially a resting-place and a refuge from the fierce Syrian sunlight. 
                    Under such a cover Jesus saw Nathanael when he was alone. Such superhuman 
                    knowledge wrought faith in Nathanael, as it did afterward in the woman of 
                    Samaria.--<span class="style7">See Proverbs 15: 3</span>.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> Nathanael answered and said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art 
                    the King of Israel. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 2 and Isaiah 9: 6</span> prophetically announce Jesus as the Son of God. These and other 
                        prophecies had just been more clearly announced by the Baptist (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1:34</span></span>).It is clear, therefore, where Nathanael 
                        got his words; but it is not so clear how well he understood them. This is the 
                        first recorded uninspired confession of the divinity of Jesus, but <span class="style7">Matthew 16: 16-17</span> indicates that it was but 
                        partially comprehended, else Peter might have been instructed by Nathanael. The 
                        expression "King of Israel" probably expressed the hope which 
                        Nathanael then entertained that Jesus would restore the ancient Jewish kingdom 
                        of David--<span class="style7">Acts 1: 6</span>.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span> Jesus 
                    answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the 
                    fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. 
                    (<span class="comm">Nathanael regarded the revelation of his character and whereabouts as a great 
                        thing, but he was destined to see yet greater miracles. Opportunities improved 
                        lead to larger privileges, and for those who believe, the evidences are 
                        increased.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily (<span class="comm">This word means 
                        "in truth." John twenty-five times represents the Saviour as thus 
                        using the double "verily." Matthew quotes the single 
                        "verily" thirty times, Mark fourteen times, and Luke seven times. 
                        The word is used to mark the importance of the truth about to be uttered</span>)
                    , I say unto you (<span class="comm">"you" is plural and includes all 
                        present as well as Nathanael</span>), Ye shall see heaven opened, and the 
                    angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. 

                    (<span class="comm">Jesus having referred to Nathanael as a true Israelite, promises to 
                        him--and to those like him--a blessing answering to Jacob's vision of 
                        the ladder; that is, that the ascent and descent of ministering angels shall be 
                        by means of Christ. Jesus calls himself the Son of man upwards of eighty times. 
                        The expression is found in all four Gospels, but is there invariably used by 
                        Christ himself. Stephen (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 7: 56</span></span>) 
                        and John (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 1: 13</span> </span>) also use this 
                        title, to indicate that the glorious being whom they saw was like 
                        Jesus--like him in his human estate. In this chapter Jesus has been called 
                        by others "The Lamb of God," "the Son of God," 
                        "the Messiah," and "the King of Israel." Jesus chooses 
                        yet another title, "Son of man," for himself. At this earliest 
                        dawning of their expectations, while their minds were thus full of his titles 
                        of glory, Jesus introduces to his disciples this one which speaks of his 
                        humanity and humility. The expression may have been suggested by <span class="style7">Daniel 7: 13-14</span>.</span>)
