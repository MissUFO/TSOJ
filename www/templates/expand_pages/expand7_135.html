        <h3>135. JESUS BETRAYED, ARRESTED, AND FORSAKEN.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">GETHSEMANE. FRIDAY, SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE DAWN.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 26: 47-56;  MARK 14: 43-52; <br>LUKE 22: 47-53;<br>JOHN 18: 2-11.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 2</span> Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the 
            place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. (<span class="comm">See p. 
                583.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> Judas then, having received the band 
            of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and the 
            Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 43</span> And straightway, while 
            he yet spake,  lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, {cometh,}  and with him a 
            multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests  
            and the scribes and the elders.  of the people.
            behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, went 
            before them (<span class="comm">The presence of Judas is mentioned by each Evangelist. His 
                treachery made a deep impression upon them. The arresting party which 
                accompanied Judas consisted of the band of officers and men from the temple 
                guard or Levitical police, Pharisees, scribes, servants, chief priests, 
                captains of the temple and elders. They were well supplied with lights, for 
                while the passover is always held when the moon is full, the moon at this time 
                of night would be near setting, and the valley of the Kidron, in which 
                Gethsemane lay, would be darkened by the shadow of the adjoining mountain</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 4</span> Jesus therefore, knowing all the things 
            that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am
            he. And Judas also, who betrayed 
            him, was standing with them.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> When therefore he said unto them, I 
            am he, they went backward, and 
            fell to the ground.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? 
            And they said, Jesus of 

            Nazareth.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> Jesus 
            answered, I told you that I am he; 
            if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> that the 
            word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost 
            not one. (<span class="comm">John mentions the foreknowledge of Jesus to remind us that he 
                could have avoided the arrest had he chosen to do so. Even the foreknowledge of 
                Elisha was difficult to deal with (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Kings 6: 8-12</span></span>). Jesus asked, "Whom seek ye?" (<span class="comm">1</span>) To openly 
                and manfully declare his identity; (<span class="comm">2</span>) to make the Jewish rulers fully 
                conscious that they were arresting him, an innocent man; (<span class="comm">3</span>) to confine the 
                arrest to himself and thus deliver his disciples. The older commentators regard 
                the falling to the ground as a miracle, but modern scholars look upon it as a 
                result of sudden fear. Jesus merely manifested his dignity and majesty, and the 
                prostration followed as a natural result.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 48</span> Now 
            he that betrayed him gave {had given} them a 
            token,  a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that 
            is he: take him.  and lead him away safely.  and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 48</span> But 
            Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 45</span> And when he was come,
            straightway he came to Jesus, and said {saith,}  Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 50</span> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, do
            that for which thou art come. (<span class="comm">Some place this event before 
                the preceding paragraph. It comports better with the fitness of things to place 
                it here. Jesus made Judas feel his utter nothingness, and his worthlessness 
                even as a betrayer. Before Judas can in any way identify Jesus, the Lord had 
                twice declared himself to be the party whom they sought. When he approaches to 
                carry out his contract, the Lord's question exposes him before all as a 
                betrayer, and not a disciple as he wished to appear to be (<span class="comm">for kissing was the 
                    common mode of salutation between men, especially between teacher and pupils</span>), 
                and when Judas brazenly persists in completing the sign, Jesus bids him do it, 
                not as a friend, but as a traitor. Little did the betrayer think that the kiss 
                of Judas would become a proverb in every nation.</span>) Then they came 

            and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. (<span class="comm">The sight of Judas 
                touching him no doubt reassured them, and they laid hands on Jesus.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 49</span> And when they that were about him saw what would follow, 
            they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 10</span> {<span class="style5">Matthew 26: 51 </span>And} {<span class="style5">Mark 14: 47 </span>But} Simon Peter a certain one of them that stood by that were with Jesus therefore having a sword stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote {struck} the servant of the high priest, and struck {cut} off his right ear. (<span class="comm">We have seen that the apostles were but scantily armed, there being only two swords in their possession. See p. 657. Peter evidently carried one of these, and stood ready to make good his boast that he would suffer, and, if need be, die in his Lord's service. evidently struck a downward blow at Malchus' head, and Malchus would have been killed had he not dodged.</span>) Now the servant's name was Malchus. (<span class="comm">John knew the household of the high priest (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 18: 16</span></span>). He knew Malchus by name, and he also knew his 
                kindred--<span class="style7">John 18: 26</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 51</span> But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye them thus far. And he touched his ear, and 
            healed him. (<span class="comm">Some think that Jesus spoke these words, "Suffer ye thus 
                far," to those who held him, asking them to loose him sufficiently to 
                enable him to touch the ear of Malchus. But the revision committee by inserting 
                "them" make Jesus address his disciples, commanding them not to 
                interfere with those who were arresting him, making it a general statement of 
                the idea which the Lord addressed specifically to Peter in the next sentence.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 11</span> Jesus therefore {<span class="style5">Matthew 26: 52 </span>Then} said {saith} unto Peter, Put up again thy {the} sword into the sheath: its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? (<span class="comm">By the healing of Malchus' ear and the words spoken to Peter, Jesus shows that the sword is not to be used either to defend the truth or to advance his kingdom. Had he not thus spoken and acted, Pilate might have doubted his words when he testified that his kingdom was not of this world (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 18: 36</span></span>). While we know better than to rely upon the aid of 
                the sword for the advance of truth, we are often tempted to put undue trust in 
                other "carnal weapons" which are equally futile. Wealth and 
                eloquence and elaborate church buildings have but little saving grace in them. 
                It is the truth which wins. By using the word "cup" John gives us 
                an echo of the agony in Gethsemane, which suggests that he expects his readers 
                to be conversant with the other Gospels. The other Evangelists, having shown 
                that Jesus was fully resolved to drink the cup, do not regard it as necessary 
                to repeat these words.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 53</span> Or thinkest thou that I 
            cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve 
            legions of angels?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">54</span> How then should the scriptures be fulfilled 
            that thus it must be? (<span class="comm">Jesus still addresses Peter. Had it accorded with 
                the divine purpose that Jesus should resist this arrest, angels and not men 
                would have been his proper and infinitely more effective rescuers. But, on the 
                contrary, it was God's purpose that he should be arrested, as the Scripture had 
                foretold.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">55</span> In that hour  Jesus answered and said 
            unto them  the multitudes,  the 
            chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against 
            him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?to seize me?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 53</span> When  I sat {was} daily 
            with you in the temple teaching,  ye stretched not 
            forth your hands against me:  and ye took me not:
            but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 56</span> But all this is come to pass, that the 
            scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. (<span class="comm">The party which came to 
                arrest Jesus was large. The word "band" used by John to describe 
                part of it is speira, which is the Greek name for the cohort, a division 
                of the Roman army which in the time of Augustus contained 555 men. Ten cohorts, 
                or a legion, were usually quartered in the castle Antonia, at the northwest 
                corner of the temple enclosure. That the whole cohort was present is not likely 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 27: 27</span></span>), but there was a 
                large enough body to represent it. The 

                Evangelists therefore 
                properly style it a great multitude. Moreover, it was a motley crowd. Its 
                strength and diversity suggest the fear that Jesus might miraculously defend 
                himself. Each part of the crowd found courage in the strength possessed by the 
                other part, the priests relying upon the solidity of the soldiers, the soldiers 
                superstitiously trusting to some spiritual power residing in the priests, etc. 
                Now, because of these fears, the preparation was as great as if some band of 
                robbers was to be taken. The questions of Jesus, therefore, show two facts: 1. 
                By their extensive preparation the rulers bore an unintentional testimony to 
                his divine power. 2. By their failure to arrest him openly in the temple, they 
                bore witness to his innocence. With his divinity and his innocence, therefore, 
                Jesus challenges them, referring to their own conduct for testimony thereto. In 
                conclusion, he cites them to the Scriptures which they were fulfilling. Our 
                Lord's dual reference to the Old Testament at this sacred time should cause us 
                to handle them with awe and reverence.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 50</span> And
            Then all of the disciples left him, and fled.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span> And a certain young man followed with him, 
            having a linen cloth cast about him, over his
            naked body: and 
            they lay hold on him;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span> but he left the linen cloth, and fled 
            naked. (<span class="comm">All the predictions of Jesus had failed to prepare the apostles for 
                the terrors of his arrest. Despite all his warnings, each apostle sought his 
                own safety. The young man who fled naked is usually presumed to be Mark 
                himself, and it is thought that he thus speaks impersonally after the manner of 
                Matthew and John. The manner of his description shows that he was not an 
                apostle. As Mark's mother resided in Jerusalem (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 12: 12, 25</span></span>), Canon Cook advances the theory that the Lord's 
                Supper was eaten in the upper room of her house, and that when the disciples 
                retired with Jesus from thence to Gethsemane, Mark slipped from his bed, threw 
                his sindon about him, and followed after them. The sindon, or linen vestment, 
                was very costly, not being worn even by the middle classes: no apostle would be 
                thus attired.</span>)
