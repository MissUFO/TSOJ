        <h3>128. PREPARATION FOR PASSOVER.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">BETHANY TO JERUSALEM. THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND, AFTER SUNSET, BEGINNING OF FRIDAY.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 26: 17-20;  MARK 14: 12-17; LUKE 22: 7-18, 24-30.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the 
            passover must be sacrificed. (<span class="comm">See p. 57. Leaven was to the Jew a symbol of 
                corruption and impurity, because it causes bread to become stale. The feast of 
                unleavened bread began properly on the fifteenth of Nisan, and lasted seven 
                days, but this was the fourteenth Nisan, the day on which the paschal lamb was 
                slain. However, it was common to blend the slaying of the passover, the 
                passover feast and the feast of the unleavened bread, and to look upon all 
                three as one great festival, and to use the names passover and unleavened bread 
                interchangeably to describe the entire eight days. This appears from the 
                writings of Josephus, who sometimes reckons the feast as beginning on the 
                fifteenth (<span class="comm">Antiquities 3: 10. 5</span>), and again as beginning on the fourteenth (<span class="comm">Wars 5: 
                    3. 1</span>). He also sometimes reckons the feast as lasting seven days (<span class="comm">Antiquities 3: 10. 
                    5</span>), and again he reckons it as lasting eight days (<span class="comm">Antiquities 3: 15. 1</span>). The 
                Rabbinists say that all the leaven was carefully removed from the houses on the 
                evening before the fourteenth Nisan. To the present day leaven is removed from 
                the houses of the Jews on the night between the thirteenth and fourteenth. 
                Hence the day could be very fittingly called "the first day of unleavened 
                bread."</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> Now  on the first day of unleavened 
            bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his {the} 
            disciples came to Jesus (<span class="comm">as the head of the household</span>), saying, 
            {say} unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make 
            ready  for thee to eat {that 
            thou mayest eat} the passover? (<span class="comm">It 

                required considerable 
                preparation. The lamb must be slain in the temple, roasted, and unleavened 
                loaves, wine, and bitter herbs, etc., must be provided (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 12: 8</span></span>), and a room for the feast must be secured.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> 
            And he sendeth {sent} Peter and John,two of his disciples,  saying, God and 
            make ready for us the passover, that we may eat. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And they said unto 
            him, Where wilt thou that we make ready? 10 And he said {
            saith} unto them, Go into the city, and  
            Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man 
            bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> and wheresoever he shall enter in, say 
            to {<span class="style7">11</span> And ye shall say unto} the master 
            of the house, {Go into the city to such 
            a man, and say unto him,}  The Teacher saith unto 
            thee,  My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy 
            house with my disciples.  Where is the {my} guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my 
            disciples? (<span class="comm">It was customary for the residents of Jerusalem to open their 
                houses for guests during this feast, and therefore Jesus might have presumed on 
                the hospitality of almost anyone; but the probability is that the man to whom 
                he sent this message was an acquaintance and a friend. It is not improbable 
                that Jesus let Peter and John thus find the place that Judas might not know its 
                whereabouts in time to bring the officers of the Sanhedrin so as to interrupt 
                the feasts which meant so much to him and to his church.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And he will 
            himself show you a large upper room furnished 
            and ready: and there make ready for us. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had 
            said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made 
            ready the passover. </p> 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> Now when even was come, {
            when it was evening} he cometh with the twelve (<span class="comm">The law required that the 
                paschal lamb should be slain "between the evenings." The Jews 
                reckoned the two evenings as from three o'clock to sunset, and from sunset to 
                nine o'clock, which was the end of the first watch. But 

                Josephus 
                tells us that the lambs were killed from the ninth to the eleventh hours, or 
                between the hours of three and five. It would take some time to dress the lamb 
                and to roast it, so that it must have been about sundown or shortly afterward 
                when Jesus and his disciples sat down to the feast.</span>)   </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And  he was sitting at meat with the twelve 
            disciples; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> and  he said unto them, With 
            desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the 
            kingdom of God. (<span class="comm">Jesus had desired to keep with his disciples this last 
                type which stood so close to the thing typified. It was a feast commemorating a 
                great deliverance from death through the sacrifice of a lamb, and the real 
                sacrifice and deliverance of which it was typical were about to be fulfilled in 
                the unfolding of the kingdom of God.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And he received a cup, and when he 
            had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> for I say unto you, I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the 
            vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. (<span class="comm">Luke brings out the parallelism 
                between the passover and the Lord's supper. Each consisted in eating followed 
                by drinking, and the closeness of the parallel is emphasized by the use of 
                almost the same words with regard to the cup. The passover was typical of the 
                Lord's suffering before the event, and the Lord's supper is typical of 
                the same thing after the event.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> And there arose also a contention 
            among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> And he 
            said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they 
            that have authority over them are called Benefactors. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> But ye
            shall not be so: but he that is the greater among you, 
            let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> For which is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? 
            is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that 
            serveth. (<span class="comm">In sending to secure the room in which 

                the paschal 
                supper was being eaten, Jesus had said, "My time is at hand." Such 
                expressions were falsely construed by the apostles. They thought that Jesus was 
                about to set up his kingdom, and began at once to contend for the chief places. 
                Jesus rebukes this false ambition in much the same manner as he had previously. 
                See pp. 430, 557, 558.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> But ye are they that have continued with me in my 
            temptations; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my 
            Father appointed unto me, 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> that ye may eat and drink at my table 
            in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of 
            Israel. (<span class="comm">The word "temptations" is here used to mean trials 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 1: 2, 3</span></span>). For the rest of the 
                passage compare the remarks on pp. 548, 549. The words concerning eating and 
                drinking at the Lord's table refer to the ancient custom of thus bestowing 
                honor and distinction (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Samual 9: 7; 19: 28</span></span>), and indicate that the apostles, being about to participate in 
                the Lord's condemnation and suffering, should in the end share his exaltation 
                and its attendant joys.</span>)</p>
