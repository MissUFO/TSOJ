        <h3>138. PETER DENIES THE LORD.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">COURT OF THE HIGH PRIEST'S RESIDENCE.<br>FRIDAY BEFORE AND ABOUT DAWN.</span>)<br>
            (<span class="comm">PALACE OF CAIAPHAS. FRIDAY.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATT. 26: 58, 69-75;  MARK 14: 54, 66-72;  <br>LUKE 22: 54-62; JOHN 18: 15-18, 25-27.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 15</span> And {<span class="style5">Matthew 26: 58 </span>But} Simon Peter followed Jesus (<span class="comm">leaving Jesus in the palace of the high priest, we now turn back to the garden of Gethsemane at the time when Jesus left it under arrest, that we may follow the course of Simon Peter in his threefold denial of the Master</span>), and so did another disciple. (<span class="comm">This other disciple was evidently the apostle John, who thus speaks of himself impersonally.</span>) Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest (<span class="comm">John's acquaintanceship appears to have been with the household as well as with the high priest personally, for we find that it is used as a permit at the doorway. It is likely that the high priest knew John rather in a business way--<span class="style7">Acts 4: 13</span></span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 54</span> And Peter had followed 
            him afar off,  unto the court of the high priest,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 16</span> but Peter was standing at the door without. 
            So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake 
            unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.  
            even within, into the court of the high priest (<span class="comm">For courts of houses see p. 
                182. It is still customary to have female porters at the houses of the great 
                <span class="style7">Acts 12: 13</span>. John would 
                have shown a truer kindness to Peter had he let him stay out</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, 
            Art thou also one of this man's 
            disciples? He saith, I am not.  and (<span class="comm">Peter</span>) 
            entered in (<span class="comm">The doorkeeper evidently recognized John as a disciple, and was 
                therefore suspicious of Peter. The cowardly "I am not" of Peter is 
                a sad contrast to the strong "I am he" of Jesus</span>),

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> Now the servants and the officers were 
            standing there, having made a 
            fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter 
            also was with them (<span class="comm">they were gathered around a little smokeless charcoal 
                fire</span>),

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 55</span> And when they had kindled a fire 
            in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter  
            sat with the officers,  in the midst of them.
            to see the end. (<span class="comm">Though his faith in Christ was 
                shaken, he still loved him enough to see what would become of him.</span>) and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the 
            light of the fire. 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 69</span> Now {<span class="style5">Luke 22: 56 </span>And} as Simon Peter was sitting {standing} without beneath in the court, there cometh {came} unto him, a certain one of the maids of the high priest;
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 67</span> and seeing Peter  
            as he sat in the light of the fire, 
            warming himself, she looked {and looking} stedfastly upon him, said, {saith,  saying,} Thou also wast with Jesus the 
            Galilaean.  the Nazarene, 
            even Jesus.  This man also was with 
            him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 70</span> But 
            he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest:  Woman, I know him not.  They said 
            therefore unto him, Art thou also one
            of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.  
            and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">71</span> And when he was gone out into the porch,
            after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also 
            art one of them. But Peter said, 
            Man, I am not.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 69</span> And  
            another  the maid saw him, and began again to 
            say {saith} unto them that were there,that stood by, This is one
            of them.  This man also was with Jesus of 
            Nazareth.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 72</span> And {<span class="style5">Mark 14: 70 </span>But} again he denied it. with an oath, I know not the man. (<span class="comm">Peter's second denial was of a quadruple nature. He denied to four different parties, but in such quick succession that the event is regarded as one.</span>)
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 60</span> But Peter said, Man, I know 
            not what thou sayest.  Again they that stood by
            came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art one of them;  for 
            thou art a Galilaean.  for thy speech maketh thee 
            known. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 26</span> One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman 
            of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with 
            him?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> {<span class="style5">Mark 14: 70 </span>But} Peter therefore denied again:
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 74</span> Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the 
            {this}  man of whom ye speak. {And immediately}

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 72</span> And straightway while he yet spake,  the 
            second time the cock crew. (<span class="comm">Exasperated by the repeated accusations, Peter 
                loses his temper and begins to emphasize his denial by profanity. Desire to 
                make good his denial is now supreme in his thoughts and the Lord whom he denies 
                is all but forgotten.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 61</span> And the Lord turned, and 
            looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered  And Peter 
            called to mind the word,  of the Lord,which Jesus had said,  how that he said 
            unto him,  Before the cock crow,  
            twice,  this thou shalt deny me thrice. 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">62</span> And he went out, And when he thought thereon, he 
            wept.  bitterly. (<span class="comm">When Peter remembered the loving 
                tenderness of Jesus manifested when he foretold Peter's crime it formed a 
                background against which the sin appeared in all its hideous enormity.</span>)
