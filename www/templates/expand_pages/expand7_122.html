        <h3>122. THE WIDOW'S MITES</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE TEMPLE. TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MARK 12: 41-44;  LUKE 21: 1-4.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5"></span> 




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 41</span> 
            And he sat down over against the treasury (<span class="comm">It 
                is said that in the court of the women there were cloisters or porticos, and 
                under the shelter of these were placed thirteen chests with trumpet-shaped 
                mouths into which offerings might be dropped. The money cast in was for the 
                benefit of the Temple. An inscription on each chest showed to which one of the 
                thirteen special items of cost or expenditure the contents would be devoted; 
                as, for the purchase of wood, or gold, or frankincense, etc.</span>), and 
            beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury (<span class="comm">We should remember 
                this calm inspection of our Lord when we are about 

                to make an 
                offering to his work. He is by no means indifferent as to our actions</span>): 
            and many that were rich cast in much.  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 21: 1</span> 
            And he looked up, and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the 
            treasury.  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 42</span> 
            And there came </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 21: 2</span> 
            And he saw a certain poor widow casting in 
            thither  and she cast in two mites, which make a 
            farthing. (<span class="comm">The lepton or mite was worth one-fifth of a cent. It was 
                a Greek coin, and the kodrantes or farthing was a Roman coin. It is 
                suggested that she might have retained one of the coins, since she had two.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 43</span> 
            And he called unto him his disciples (<span class="comm">he had found an object-lesson 
                which he wished them to see</span>), and said unto them, Verily  Of a truth I say unto you,  This poor 
            widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury: </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> 
            for they {these}all did cast in of their superfluity;  
            unto the gifts;  but she of her want did cast in all 
            that she had, even   all the living that she had. {all her 
            living.} (<span class="comm">We are disposed to measure the value of actions quantitatively 
                rather than qualitatively. Moreover, we are better judges of actions than of 
                motives, and can see the outward conduct much clearer than the inward 
                character. God, therefore, in his word, constantly teaches us that he looks 
                rather upon the inward than the outward. In this case, the value of the woman's 
                gift was measured, not by quantity, but its quality; in quantity it was two 
                mites, in quality it was the gift of all she had. From considering the corrupt 
                character of the Pharisees, Jesus must have turned with pleasure to look upon 
                the beautiful heart of this devout widow.</span>)</p>
