        <h3>40. JESUS HEALS MULTITUDES.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 12: 15-21;  MARK 3: 7-12.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 15</span> And Jesus perceiving 
            it withdrew  with his disciples from thence:  to the sea (<span class="comm">This was the first withdrawal of Jesus for the avowed purpose of self-preservation. After this we find Jesus constantly retiring to avoid the plots of his enemies. 
                The Sea of Galilee, with its boats and its shores touching different 
                jurisdictions, formed a convenient and fairly safe retreat</span>):and many followed him; and a great 
            multitude from Galilee followed; and from Jud&aelig;a,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 8</span> and from 
            Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a 
            great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him. 
            (<span class="comm">Idum&aelig;a was the land formerly inhabited by the Edomites. It is a Greek 
                word from "Edom," which was another word for Esau (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 25: 30</span></span>), and means red. This land was 
                originally the narrow strip reaching from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea, lying 
                between the Arabah on the west, and the desert on the east, being about one 
                hundred miles long and fifteen or twenty broad. During the Babylonian 
                captivity, however, the Edomites took possession of the southern portion of 
                Jud&aelig;a, and Strabo says that they encroached as far as to the city of 
                Hebron. They were conquered by John Hyrcanus, one of the Asmon&aelig;an princes 
                about 120 <span style="text-transform:small-caps" id="vii.iv-p1.2">b.c.</span>, and were by him 
                made subservient to the law and incorporated with the Jewish people. As before 


                noted, Herod the Great sprang from this people. Tyre and Sidon 
                were Phoenician cities on the Mediterranean seacoast, westward from the Lake of 
                Galilee.</span>) and he healed them all,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 16</span> and 
            charged them that they should not make him known:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 17</span> that it might 
            be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 42: 1-4</span>. Partly taken from the LXX 
                and part an original translation</span>), saying,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 18</span> Behold, my 
            servant whom I have chosen; My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will 
            put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. (<span class="comm">The 
                word translated "servant," means also son, but it is rightly 
                translated "servant" here, for the Father uses another word when he 
                would designate Jesus as specifically his Son (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 3: 17; 17: 5</span></span>). Jesus was a servant in form (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 10: 9</span></span>). The word "judgment," as 
                used in the Old Testament, from which it is here translated, means rule, 
                doctrine, truth. It is usually here understood as meaning that Jesus would 
                reveal the gospel or the full truth of the new dispensation to the Gentiles.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 19</span> He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; Neither shall any one hear his voice 
            in the streets.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 20</span> A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking 
            flax shall he not quench, Till he send forth judgment unto victory. (<span class="comm">These 
                two verses find their fulfillment in the events of this paragraph. Jesus did 
                not strive nor quarrel with the Pharisees, but having victoriously put them to 
                silence, he meekly and quietly withdrew from their presence, and the healing of 
                the multitudes which followed him as aptly fulfilled the prediction about the 
                reed and the flax, for these two words, symbolic of weakness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 36: 6</span></span>) and patience-trying annoyance 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Proverbs 10: 26</span></span>), fitly represented the 
                sick and lame and blind--sinners who, by affliction, had been made 
                contrite and poor in spirit, remorseful and repentant, and who were brought to 
                Jesus to be healed. If the hollow cylinder of the reed is bruised, its strength 
                is gone, and it is no longer able to stand erect. Flax was then used where we 
                now use cotton, as wicking for lamps. Imperfection in the fiber of it would 
                cause it to smoke. A violent 

                man, irritated by the fumes of the 
                smoking wick, would put it out, and cast it from him. But the Lord's servant 
                would patiently fan it to flames. The statement that he would not break these 
                bruised reeds, nor quench this smoking flax, was an emphatic declaration, by 
                contrast, that he would heal their bruises and fan their dying energies and 
                resolutions into a flame, until he sent forth judgment unto victory; i. 
                e., until the gospel--the authoritative announcement of the divine 
                purpose or will--shall be sent forth and advanced to its final triumph. 
                Christ shall show patient mercy and forbearance until the gospel shall 
                practically exclude the need of it, by triumphing over Jewish opposition and 
                Gentile impiety so as to bring about universal righteousness.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 21</span> And in his 
            name shall the Gentiles hope. (<span class="comm">This verse sets forth the breadth of 
                Christ's conquest over all nations. It reaches beyond our times into a future 
                which is yet to be. But it was partially fulfilled by the presence of 
                Idum&aelig;ans and citizens of Tyre and Sidon in the multitudes which Jesus 
                healed--unless we say that only Jews from these quarters are meant, which 
                is not likely.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 9</span> And he spake to his disciples, 
            that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should 
            throng him:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 10</span> for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as 
            plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him. (<span class="comm">Literally, they 
                "fell upon him;" such was their eagerness to be healed by touching 
                him.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 11</span> And unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before 
            him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 12</span> And he charged 
            them much that they should not make him known. (<span class="comm">Because this was not the 
                right time, nor were they the right witnesses to make him known.</span>)
