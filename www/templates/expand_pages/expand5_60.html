        <h3>60. SIGN SEEKERS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">GALILEE ON THE SAME DAY AS THE LAST SECTION.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW. 12: 38-45;  LUKE 11: 24-36.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 11: 29</span>   And when the multitudes were gathering together 
            unto him,  
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 38</span>   Then certain of the scribes 
            and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee. 
            (<span class="comm">Having been severely rebuked by Jesus, it is likely that the scribes and 
                Pharisees asked for a sign that they might appear to the multitude more 
                fair-minded and open to conviction than Jesus had represented them to be. Jesus 
                had just wrought a miracle, so that their request shows that they wanted 
                something different. We learn from Mark (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 8: 11</span></span>) that they wanted a sign, not coming from him, but from heaven, 
                such a sign as other prophets and leaders had given (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 9: 22-24; 16: 4; Joshua 10: 12; 1 Samuel 7: 9, 10; 12: 
                        16-18; 1 Kings 18: 36-38; 2 Kings 1: 10; Isaiah 38: 8</span></span>). "In Jewish 
                superstition it was held that demons and false gods could give signs on 
                earth, but only the true God signs from heaven" (<span class="comm">Alford
                </span>). The request was the renewal of the one which had assailed him at the 
                beginning of his ministry (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 2: 18</span></span>), and re-echoed the wilderness temptation to advance himself by vulgar display 
                rather than by the power of a life of divine holiness.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span>   But he answered 
            and said unto them, {he began to say,} This 
            generation is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign;  
            An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign 

            (<span class="comm">While the Jews of that generation could well be accused literally of adultery, 
                Jesus here evidently uses it in its symbolic sense as used by the prophets. 
                They represented Israel as being married to God and as being untrue to 
                him--<span class="style7">Exodus 34: 15; Jeremiah 3: 14, 20</span></span>); and there shall no sign be given to it,  but the sign of Jonah.  the prophet 
            (<span class="comm">They did not accept miracles of healing as a sign, and only one other kind of 
                sign was given; viz.: that of Jonah. Jonah was shown to be a true prophet of 
                God, and Nineveh received him as such because he was rescued from the fish's 
                belly, and Jesus was declared to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the 
                dead--<span class="style7">Romans 1: 4</span></span>): 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span>  For 
            as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall 
            the Son of man be three days and three nights. (<span class="comm">Jesus was one full day, two 
                full nights, and parts of two other days in the grave. But, as the Jews 
                reckoned a part of a day as a whole day when it occurred at the beginning or 
                end of a series, he was correctly spoken of as being three days in the grave. 
                The Jews had three phrases, viz.: "on the third day," "after 
                three days," and "three days and three nights," which all 
                meant the same thing; that is, three days, two of which might be fractional 
                days. With them three full days and nights would be counted as four days unless 
                the count began at sundown, the exact beginning of a day (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 10: 1-30</span></span>). For instances of Jewish computation of 
                days, see <span class="style7">Genesis 42: 17, 18; 1 Kings 12: 5, 12; Esther 4: 16; 5: 1; Matthew 27: 63, 64</span>. The Greek word here 
                translated "whale" is "sea monster." It is called in 
                Jonah "a great fish" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jonah 1: 17</span></span>). Because of the supposed smallness of the whale's throat, many 
                think that it was the white shark, which is still plentiful in the 
                Mediterranean, and which sometimes measures sixty feet in length, and is large 
                enough to swallow a man whole. But it is now a well-established fact that 
                whales can swallow a man, and there are many instances of such swallowings on 
                record. The expression "heart of the earth" does not mean its 
                center. The Jews used the word "heart" to denote the interior of 
                anything (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ezekiel 28: 2</span></span>). The phrase 
                is here 

                used as one which would emphatically indicate the actual 
                burial of Christ.</span>)   

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 11: 30</span>    For even as Jonah became a 
            sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
            (<span class="comm">Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, situated on the Tigris River, 
                and in its day the greatest city of the world. Jonah's preservation was a sign 
                from heaven, because wrought without human instrumentality. The resurrection of 
                Christ was such a sign to the Jews, but rejecting it, they continued to seek 
                other signs--<span class="style7">1 Corinthians 1: 22.</span></span>) 


        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 41</span>   The men of Nineveh shall stand up in judgment with 
            this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of 
            Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here. (<span class="comm">Literally, repented into 
                the teaching of Jonah. The meaning is that they repented so that they followed 
                the course of life which the preaching prescribed. The phrase, "stand 
                up," refers to the Jewish and Roman custom which required the witness to 
                stand up while testifying in a criminal case. The idea here is that the 
                Ninevites, having improved the lesser advantage or privilege, would condemn the 
                Jews for having neglected the greater. Nineveh's privilege may be counted thus: 
                a sign-accredited prophet preaching without accompanying miracles, and a 
                forty-day period of repentance. In contrast to this the Jewish privileges ran 
                thus: the sign-accredited Son of God preaching, accompanied by miracles, in 
                which many apostles and evangelists participated, a forty-year period in which 
                to repent.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span>   The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with 
            this generation, and shall condemn it: {with the men 
            of this generation, and shall condemn them:} for she came from the ends of the 
            earth (<span class="comm">a Hebraism, indicating a great distance</span>) to hear the wisdom of 
            Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here. (<span class="comm">The queen of Sheba is 
                supposed to have been queen of Sab&aelig;a, or Arabia Felix, which lies in the 
                southern part of the peninsula between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. But 
                Josephus says she was from Ethiopia in Africa. Her testimony will also be based 
                on the compared privileges, which 

                stand thus: notwithstanding the 
                dangers and inconveniences, she came a great distance to be taught of Solomon, 
                but the Jews rejected the teaching of the Son of God, though he brought it to 
                them. The teaching of Solomon related largely to this world, but Christ taught 
                as to the world to come.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span>   But the unclean 
            spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places 
            (<span class="comm">places which are as cheerless to him as deserts are to man</span>), seeking 
            rest, and findeth it not. (<span class="comm">Rest is the desire of every creature. Jesus here 
                gives us a graphic description of utter wretchedness.</span>)   
            and finding none,  

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> Then he saith, I will return into {turn back unto} my house (<span class="comm">he still claimed it as his property</span>) whence I came out. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 11: 25</span> And when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. (<span class="comm">It was empty, having no indwelling Spirit, swept of all righteous impressions and good influences, and garnished with things inviting to an evil spirit.</span>)</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 45</span>   Then (<span class="comm">seeing this inviting condition</span>) goeth 
            he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits (<span class="comm">to reinforce and entrench 
                himself</span>) more evil than himself (<span class="comm">while all demons are wicked they are 
                not equally so</span>), and they enter in and dwell there (<span class="comm">take up their 
                permanent abode there</span>): and the last state of that man becometh worse 
            than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation. (<span class="comm">In the 
                application of this parable, we should bear in mind that it tells of two 
                states or conditions experienced by one man, and the comparison is 
                between these two states or conditions and not between the condition of the man 
                and other men. Such being the parable, the application of it is plain, for 
                Jesus says, "Even so shall it be unto this evil generation." We are 
                not, therefore, to compare that generation with any previous one, as many do; 
                for such would be contrary to the terms of the parable. It is simply an 
                assertion that the last state of that generation would be worse than the first. 
                The reference is to the continually increasing wickedness of the Jews, which 
                culminated in the dreadful scenes which preceded the destruction of Jerusalem. 
                They were now like a man with one 

                evil spirit; they would then be 
                like a man with seven more demons added, each of which was worse than the 
                original occupant.</span>)   

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 11: 27</span>   And it came to pass, as he 
            said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, 
            and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which 
            thou didst suck. (<span class="comm">This woman is the first on record to fulfill Mary's 
                prediction (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1: 48</span></span>). It is the only 
                passage in the New Testament which even suggests the idolatry of Mariolatry, 
                but it was far enough from it, being merely a womanly way of expressing 
                admiration for the son by pronouncing blessings upon the mother who was so 
                fortunate as to bear him.</span>)

            But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that 
            hear the word of God, and keep it. (<span class="comm">Jesus does not deny the fact that Mary 
                was blessed, but corrects any false idea with regard to her by pointing to the 
                higher honor of being a disciple which was attainable by every one. Mary's 
                blessing as a disciple was greater than her blessing as a mother; her moral and 
                spiritual relation to Jesus was more precious than her maternal. Mary's 
                blessings came through believing God's word (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1: 45</span></span>). To know Christ after the Spirit is more blessed than to know 
                him after the flesh--<span class="style7">2 Corinthians 5: 15, 16; John 16: 7.</span></span>)
