        <h3>154. NINTH AND TENTH APPEARANCES OF JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 24: 44-49;  ACTS 1: 3-8;  1 CORINTHIANS 15: 7.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">I Corinthians 15: 7</span> then he appeared to James (<span class="comm">of this appearance also we have no details</span>); then to all the apostles;        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Acts 1: 3</span> To whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God (<span class="comm">this shows us that Jesus spoke many things at his appearances beside the brief words which are recorded</span>):

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye heard from me (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 14: 16, 26; 15: 26</span></span>):

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence. (<span class="comm">This promised baptism came ten days later, at Pentecost.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 44</span> And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me. (<span class="comm">That is, these recent events are simply what I told you should come to pass according to the Scriptures, but ye did not understand. The phrase, &quot;while I was yet,&quot; etc., shows that in the mind of Jesus, he was already parted from them, and his presence was the exception and not the rule.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> Then opened he their mind, that they 
            might understand the scriptures (<span class="comm">some think that this 
                illumination was of a miraculous nature, and confound it with what the Lord is 
                said to have done at <span class="style7">John 20: 22</span>, but 
                <span class="style7">Luke 24: 46</span> suggests that he did it 
                by discourse, just as he had done it already to the two on the way to 
                Emmaus--<span class="style7">Luke 24: 27</span></span>);        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, 
            and rise again from the dead the third day (<span class="comm">Both the written prophecy and 
                the unwritten nature of things required that Christ should do as he had done. 
                The saying forms an important credential for the Book of Jonah; where else have 
                we the period of three days fixed as the time between our Lord's burial and 
                resurrection?--<span class="style7">Matthew 12: 38-40</span></span>);
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> and that repentance and remission of sins 
            should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from 
            Jerusalem. (<span class="comm">See previous section.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> Ye are 
            witnesses of these things.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> And behold, I send forth the promise 
            of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power 
            from on high.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Acts 1: 6</span> They (<span class="comm">the apostles</span>) 
            therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou 
            at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? (<span class="comm">Despite all that they had seen 
                and heard, the apostles were still expecting that Jesus would revive the old 
                Jewish kingdom, and have himself enthroned in Jerusalem as the heir and 
                successor of David.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know 
            times or seasons, which the Father hath set within His own authority.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye 
            shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and 
            unto the uttermost part of the earth. (<span class="comm">Jesus enlightens them as to their 
                duty, and not as to the kingdom; Pentecost would make all clear as to the 
                nature of Christ's rule and dominion.</span>)
