        <h3>14. JOHN THE BAPTIST</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE WILDERNESS OF JUDEA,</h3>
        <h3>AND ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN,</h3>
        <h3>OCCUPYING SEVERAL MONTHS,</h3>
        <h3>PROBABLY A.D. 25 OR 26.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 3: 1- 12; MARK 1: 1- 8; LUKE 3: 1- 18. </h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 1</span> The beginning of the gospel (<span class="comm">John begins his 
                Gospel from eternity, where the Word is found coexistent with God. Matthew 
                begins with Jesus, the humanly generated son of Abraham and David, born in the 
                days of Herod the king. Luke begins with the birth of John the Baptist, the 
                Messiah's herald; and Mark begins with the ministry of John the Baptist. While 
                the three other evangelists take a brief survey of the preparation of 
                the gospel, Mark looks particularly to the period when it began to be 
                preached. Gospel means good news, and news is not news until it is 
                proclaimed. The gospel began to be preached or proclaimed with the ministry of 
                John the Baptist (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 16: 16</span></span>). His 
                ministry was the dawn of that gospel of which Christ's preaching was the 
                sunrise</span>) of Jesus (<span class="comm">Our Lord's name as a human being; it means 
                "Saviour"</span>) Christ (<span class="comm">Though this is also sometimes used as a 
                name, it is in reality our Lord's title. It means "the 
                Anointed," and is equivalent to saying that Jesus is our Prophet, Priest 
                and King</span>) the Son of God. (<span class="comm">This indicates our Lord's eternal 
                nature; it was divine. Mark's gospel was written to establish that fact, 
                which is the foundation of the church </span>(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 16: 
                    18</span></span>). John's Gospel was written for a like purpose (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 20: 31</span></span>). John uses the phrase "Son of God" twenty-nine times, and Mark seven times. As these two 
            evangelists wrote chiefly for Gentile readers, they emphasized the divinity of 
            Jesus, and paid less attention to his Jewish ancestry. But Matthew, writing for 
            Hebrews, prefers the title "Son of David," which he applies to 
            Jesus some nine times, that he may identify him as the Messiah promised in the 
            seed of David (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Samuel 7: 12; Psalm 72: 
                    1- 17; 89: 3, 4; 132: 11, 12.</span></span>)

On Aug. 19, 767, Augustus died and Tiberius became sole ruler. Luke counts from the beginning of the joint rule, and his fifteen years bring us to 779. In August, 779, Tiberius began his fifteenth year, and about December of that year Jesus would have completed his thirtieth year</span>) of Tiberius C&aelig;sar (<span class="comm">He was born B.C. 41, died March 16, A.D. 37. As a citizen he distinguished himself as orator, soldier and public official. But as emperor he was slothful, self-indulgent, indescribably licentious, vindictive and cruel. He was a master of dissimulation and cunning, and was a veritable scourge to his people. But he still found flatterers even in Palestine, C&aelig;sarea Philippi, and the town Tiberias being named for him</span>), Pontius Pilate (<span class="comm">see mention of him in account of our Lord's trial</span>) being governor of Jud&aelig;a (<span class="comm">The province of Jud&aelig;a was subdued by Pompey and brought under Roman control in B.C. 63. Its history from that date till the governorship of Pilate can be found in Josephus</span>), and Herod (<span class="comm">Also called Antipas. The ruler who murdered John the Baptist and who assisted at the trial of Jesus</span>) being tetrarch (<span class="comm">this word means properly the ruler of a fourth part of a country, but was used loosely for any petty tributary prince</span>) of Galilee (<span class="comm">This province lay north of Samaria, and measured about twenty-five miles from north to south, and twenty-seven miles from east to west. It was a rich and fertile country</span>), and his brother (<span class="comm">half-brother</span>) Philip (<span class="comm">He was distinguished by justice and moderation, the one decent man in the Herodian family. He married Salome, who obtained John the Baptist's head for a dance. He built C&aelig;sarea Philippi, and transformed Bethsaida Julius from a village to a city, and died there A.D. 44. After his death his domains became part of the Roman province of Syria tetrarch of the region of Itur&aelig;a</span> (<span class="comm">A district thirty miles long by twenty-five broad, lying north of Batan&aelig;a, east of Mt. Hermon, west of Trachonitis. It received its name from Jetur, son of Ishmael (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 25: 15</span></span>). Its Ishmaelite inhabitants were conquered by Aristobulus, king of Jud&aelig;a, B.C. 100, and forced by him to accept the Jewish faith. They were marauders, and famous for the use of the bow</span>) and Trachonitis (<span class="comm">A district about twenty-two miles from north to south by fourteen from east to west. Its name means &quot;rough&quot; or &quot;stony,&quot; and it amply deserves it. It lies between Itur&aelig;a and the desert, and has been infested with robbers from the earliest ages. It is called the Argob in the Old Testament, &quot;an ocean of basaltic rock and boulders, tossed about in the wildest confusion, and intermingled with fissures and crevices in every direction&quot;</span>), and Lysanias (<span class="comm">Profane history gives us no account of this man. It tells of a Lysanias, king of Chalcis, under Mt. Lebanon, who was put to death by Mark Antony, B.C. 36, or sixty-odd years before this, and another who was tetrarch of Abilene in the reigns of Caligula and Claudius twenty years after this. He probably was son of the first and father of the second</span>) tetrarch of Abilene (<span class="comm">The city of Abila (<span class="comm">which comes from the Hebrew word &quot;abel,&quot; meaning &quot;meadow&quot;</span>) is eighteen miles from Damascus and thirty-eight from Baalbec. The province laying about it is mentioned because it subsequently formed part of the Jewish territory, being given to Herod Agrippa 1: by Emperor Claudius about A.D. 41</span>), 2: in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas (<span class="comm">Annas had been high priest 7- 14 A.D., when he was deposed by the procurator, Gratus. Caiaphas was son-in-law of and successor to Annas. Luke gives both names, one as the rightful and the other as the acting high priest.</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 4: 6</span></span>). Gentile innovations 
            had made sad havoc with the Jewish law as to this office. In the last one 
            hundred and seven years of the temple's existence there were no less 
            than twenty-eight high priests. Luke is the only one who fixes the time when 
            Jesus began his ministry. He locates it by emperor and governor, tetrarch and 
            high priest, as an event of world-wide importance, and of concern to all the 
            kingdoms of men. He conceives of it as Paul did (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 26: 26</span></span>), the word of God (<span class="comm">The divine 
                commission which bade John enter his career as a prophet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 1: 2; Ezekiel 6: 1</span></span>). Prophets gave temporary 
                and limited manifestations of God's will (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 1: 
                        1, 2</span></span>). Jesus is the everlasting and unlimited manifestation of the 
                divine purpose and of the very Godhead (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 
                        14: 9; 12: 45; Colossians 1: 15; Hebrews 1: 3; 2 Corinthians 4: 6</span></span>) came unto 
                John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. (<span class="comm">The wilderness of 
                    Jud&aelig;a is that almost uninhabitable mass of barren ridges extending the 
                    whole length of the Dead Sea, and a few miles further north. It is from five to 
                    ten miles wide.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 3: 1</span> And in those days (<span class="comm">Some take this expression as referring to the years when Jesus dwelt at Nazareth. But it is better to regard it as a Hebraism equivalent to &quot;that age&quot; or &quot;that era&quot;(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 2: 11</span></span>). It contrasts the era when the Baptist lived with the era when 
                Matthew wrote his Gospel, just as we say "in these days of 
                enlightenment" when we wish to contrast the present time with the days of 
                the American Revolution</span>) cometh John (<span class="comm">he was cousin to Jesus</span>) the 
            Baptist (<span class="comm">So called because God first gave through him the ordinance of 
                baptism. It has been erroneously thought by some that John borrowed this 
                ordinance from the Jewish practice of proselyte baptism. This could not be, for 
                John baptized his converts, but Jewish proselytes baptized themselves. The law 
                required such self-baptism of all persons who were unclean (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 14. 9; Numbers 19: 19; 8: 7; Leviticus 15, 16 </span></span>). More than twenty distinct cases are specified in which the law required 
                bathing or self-baptism, and it is to these Paul refers when he states that the 
                law consisted in part "of divers baptisms" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 9: 10</span></span>). But the law did not require this of proselytes, 
                and proselyte baptism was a human appendage to the divinely given Jewish 
                ritual, just as infant baptism is to the true Christian ritual. 
                Proselyte baptism is not mentioned in history till the third century of the 
                Christian era. Neither Josephus, nor Philo, nor the Apocrypha, nor the Targums 
                say anything about it, though they all mention proselytes. In fact, the oldest 
                mention of it in Jewish writings is in the Babylonian Gemara, which was 
                completed about five hundred years years after Christ. The New Testament 
                implies the non-existence of proselyte baptism (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 21: 25; John 1: 25, 33</span></span>). John could hardly have been called the Baptist, had he used an old-time rite in the accustomed manner. The Baptist was a link between the Old and New Testament. Belonging to the Old, he announced the New</span>), preaching (<span class="comm">Not sermonizing, but crying out a message as a king's herald making a proclamation, or a policeman crying &quot;Fire!&quot; in a slumbering town. His discourse was brief and unembellished. Its force lay in the importance of the truth announced. It promised to the Hebrew the fulfillment of two thousand years of longing. It demanded repentance, but for a new reason. The old call to repentance had wooed with the promise of earthly blessings, and warned with the threat of earthly judgments; but John's repentance had to do with the kingdom of heaven and things eternal. It suggested the Holy Spirit as a reward, and unquenchable fire as the punishment</span>) in the wilderness of Jud&aelig;a (<span class="comm">that part of the wilderness which John chose for the scene of his ministry is a desert plain, lying along the western bank of the Jordan, between Jericho and the Dead Sea</span>) , saying,</p>

                the motive for repentance. Repentance is the duty, and the approach of the 
                kingdom is the motive inciting to it. Only by repentance could the people be 
                prepared for the kingdom. Those who are indifferent to the obligations of an 
                old revelation would be ill-prepared to receive a new one</span>) the kingdom of 
            heaven is at hand (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Daniel 2: 44</span></span>). <span class="comm">"Kingdom of heaven" is peculiar to Matthew, who uses it thirty-one 
                times. He also joins with the other evangelists in calling it the kingdom of 
                God. We know not why he preferred the expression, "kingdom of 
                heaven."</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet (<span class="comm">Isaiah flourished from about 759 to 699 B.C.</span>),saying, Behold (<span class="comm">The clause beginning with &quot;Behold,&quot; and ending with &quot;way,&quot; is taken from <span class="style7">Malachi 3: 1</span></span>). <span class="comm">The Revised Version makes 
                Mark quote this passage as if it were from Isaiah, the reading being 
                "written in Isaiah the prophet," but the King James' version gives 
                the reading "written in the prophets." Following the reasoning of 
                Canon Cook, we hold that the latter was the original reading--see 
                Speaker's Commentary, note at the end of Mark 1</span>) I send my messenger 
            (<span class="comm">John the Baptist was that messenger</span>) before thy face (<span class="comm">Malachi says, 
                "my face." "Thy" and "my" are used 
                interchangeably, because of the unity of the Deity (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 10: 30</span></span>), who shall prepare thy way (<span class="comm">Mark says little about the prophets, but at the outset of his Gospel he calls attention to the fact that the entire pathway of Jesus was the subject of prophetical prediction</span>); The voice (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 40: 3, 4</span></span>) quoted from the LXX. The words 
                were God's, the voice was John's. So Paul also spake (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Thessalonians 2: 1- 13</span></span>). It was prophesied before he was 
                born that John should be a preparing messenger for Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1: 17</span></span>) 
                born that John should be a preparing messenger for Christ <span class="style7">Luke 1: 17</span> of one crying in the wilderness 
                (<span class="comm">This prophecy of Isaiah's could relate to none but John, for no other prophet 
                    ever made the wilderness the scene of his preaching. But John always preached 
                    there, and instead of going to the people, he compelled the people to come out 
                    to him. John was the second Elijah. The claims of all who in these days profess 
                    to be reincarnations of Elijah may be tested and condemned by this 
                    prophecy, for none of them frequent the wilderness</span>), Make ye ready 
                the way (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 35: 8- 10</span></span>). Isaiah's language is highly figurative. It represents a 
                band of engineers and workmen preparing the road for their king through a 
                rough, mountainous district. The figure was familiar to the people of the East, 
                and nearly every generation there witnessed such road-making. The haughty 
                Seriramis leveled the mountains before her. Josephus, describing the march of 
                Vespasian, says that there went before him such as were to make the road even 
                and straight, and if it were anywhere rough and hard, to smooth it over, to 
                plane it, and to cut down woods that hindered the march, that the army might 
                not be tired. Some have thought that Isaiah's prophecy referred primarily to 
                the return of the Jewish captives from Babylon. But it refers far more directly 
                to the ministry of the Baptist; for it is not said that the way was to be 
                prepared for the people, but for Jehovah himself. It is a beautiful figure, but 
                the real preparation was the more beautiful transformation of repentance. By 
                inducing repentance, John was to prepare the people to receive Jesus and his 
                apostles, and to hearken to their preaching</span>) of the Lord, Make his paths 
            straight.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> Every valley shall be filled, And every mountain and 
            hill shall be brought low; And the crooked shall become straight, And the rough 
            way smooth (<span class="comm">The literal meaning of this passage is expressed at(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Zechariah 4: 7</span></span>). Commentators give detailed 
                application of this prophecy, and, following their example, we may regard the 
                Pharisees and Sadducees as mountains of self-righteousness, needing to be 
                thrown down, and thereby brought to meekness and humility; the outcasts and 
                harlots as valleys of humiliation, needing to be exalted and filled with hope; 
                and the publicans and soldiers as crooked and rough byways, needing to be 
                straightened and smoothed with proper details of righteousness. But the 
                application is general, and not to be limited to such details. However, civil 
                tyranny, and ecclesiastical pride must be leveled, and the rights of the common 
                people must be exalted before for kingdom of God can enter in</span>);</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And all flesh shall see the salvation of God (<span class="comm">This last clause 
                of the prophecy is added by Luke alone. He loves to dwell upon the universality 
                of Christ's gospel.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 4</span> John came, who baptized in 
            the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto the remission of

                forward to the cleansing effected by the shedding of his blood, as all rites 
                now look back to it. But in popular estimation John's baptism was no doubt 
                regarded as consummating an immediate forgiveness</span>).</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 3: 4</span> Now John himself (<span class="comm">Himself indicates that John's manner of life differed from that of his disciples. He did not oblige them to practice the full measure of his abstinence</span>) had his raiment of (<span class="comm">John's dress and food preached in harmony with his voice. His clothing and fare rendered him independent of the rich and great, so that he could more freely and plainly rebuke their sins. Calling others to repentance, he himself set an example of austere self-denial. So much so that the Pharisees said he had a demon (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 11: 18</span></span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 6</span> And was clothed 
            with  camel's hair (<span class="comm">Camels were plentiful in the 
                East. Their finer hair was woven into elegant cloths; but that which was 
                coarser and shaggier was made into a fabric like our druggets, and used for the 
                coats of shepherds and camel-drivers, and for the covering of tents. Prophets 
                often wore such cloth(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Zechariah 13: 4</span></span>), and no doubt it was the habitual garb of John's prototype <span class="style7">2 Kings 1: 8</span></span>). In Elijah's day there was demand 
            for protest against the sad havoc which Phoenician luxury and licentiousness 
            were making with the purer morals of Israel; and in John's day a like protest 
            was needed against a like contamination wrought by Greek manners and customs. 
            Both prophets, by their austerity, rebuked such apostasy, and Jezebel answered 
            the rebuke by attempting Elijah's life, while Herodias actually took the life 
            of John. As a herald, John was suited to the King whose appearing he was to 
            announce, for Jesus was meek and lowly (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Zechariah 9: 
                    9</span></span>),  and had no form nor comeliness that he should be desired (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 53: 2</span></span>), and a leathern girdle about his loins (<span class="comm">The loose skirts worn in 
                the East required a girdle to bind them to the body. This was usually made of 
                linen or silk, but was frequently more costly, being wrought with silver and 
                gold. John's girdle was plain, undressed leather</span>); And his food was

                Oriental cities they are found for sale in the market. But they are regarded as 
                fit only for the poor. They are frequently seasoned with camel's milk and

                        14: 26</span></span>). Many of the trees in the plains of Jericho, such as the 
                palm, fig, manna, ash and tamarisk, exuded sweet gums, which went by the name 
                of tree honey, but there is no need to suppose, as some do, that this was what 
                John ate. The country once abounded in wild bees, and their honey was very 
                plentiful. We have on the record an instance of the speed with which they could 
                fill the place which they selected for their hives (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Judges 14: 5- 9</span></span>). The diet of the Baptist was very 
                light, and Jesus so speaks of it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 11: 
                        18</span></span>). He probably had no set time for his meals, and all days were 
                more or less fast-days. Thus John gave himself wholly to his ministry, and 
                became a voice--all voice. John took the wilderness for a church, and 
                filled it. He courted no honors, but no Jew of his time received more of them, 
                and by some he was even regarded as Messiah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 3: 15.</span></span>)</p>

                every stage of the Greek language this has been the unquestioned meaning of the 
                verb baptizo, and it still retains this meaning in modern Greek. In 
                accordance with this meaning, the Greek Church, in all its branches, has 
                uniformly practiced immersion from the earliest period to the present time. 
                Greek Christians never speak of other denominations as "baptizing by 
                sprinkling," but they say, "they baptize instead of 
                baptizing." John's baptism was instituted of God</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 33</span></span>), just as Christian baptism was instituted by 
            Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 28: 19</span></span>). The 
            Pharisees recognized John's rite as so important as to require divine 
            authority, and even then they underestimated it, regarding it as a mere 
            purification--Josephus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ant. 18: 5, 2</span></span>) in the river Jordan, 
            confessing their sins. (<span class="comm">As John's baptism was for the remission of sins, it 
                was very proper that it should be preceded by a confession. The context 
                indicates that the confession was public and general. There is no hint of such 
                auricular confession as is practiced by the Catholics. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 19: 18</span></span>). John, writing to baptized 
                Christians, bids them to confess their sins, that Jesus may forgive them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 1: 9</span></span>). Christian baptism is 
                also for the remission of sins (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 2:

                baptized has sins to be remitted, and it seems to be a sufficient pubic 
                expression of confession as to sins; for while John's baptism called for a 
                confession sins, Christian baptism calls only for a confession of faith in 
                Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 22: 16; Romans 10: 9, 10; Mark

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees (<span class="comm">Josephus tells us that these two leading sects of the Jews started about the same time in the days of Jonathan, the high priest, or B.C. 159- 144. But the sentiments which at that time divided the people into two rival parties entered the minds and hearts of the Jews immediately after the return from the Babylonian captivity. These returned Jews differed as to the attitude and policy which Israel should manifest toward the neighboring heathen. Some contended for a strict separation between the Jews and all pagan peoples. These eventually formed the Pharisee party, and the name Pharisee means &quot;the separate.&quot; Originally these men were genuine patriots and reformers, but afterwards the majority of them became mere formalists. As theologians the Pharisees represented the orthodox party, and were followed by the vast majority of the people. They believed (<span class="comm">1</span>) in the resurrection of the dead; (<span class="comm">2</span>) a future state with rewards and punishments; (<span class="comm">3</span>) angels and spirits; and (<span class="comm">4</span>) a special providence of God carried out by angels and spirits. As a sect they are said to have numbered six thousand at the time of Herod's death. They were the patriotic party, and the zealots were their extreme section. They covered an extremely selfish spirit with a pious formalism, and by parading their virtues they obtained an almost unbounded influence over the people. By exposing their hypocrisy, Jesus sought to destroy their power over the multitude, and incurred that bitter enmity with which they pursued him to his death. But certain other of the captives who returned from Babylon desired a freer intercourse with the pagans, and sought to break away from every restraint which debarred therefrom. These became Sadducees. They consented to no other restraint than the Scriptures themselves imposed, and they interpreted these as laxly as possible. Some take their name to means &quot;the party of 'righteousness,'&quot; but more think it comes from their founder, Zadok, and is a corruption of the word Zadokite. Zadok flourished 260 B.C. His teacher, Antigonus Soch&aelig;us, taught him to serve God disinterestedly--that is, without hope of reward or punishment. From his teaching Zadok inferred that there was no future state of rewards or punishment, and on this belief founded his sect. From this fundamental doctrine sprang the other tenets of the Sadducees. They denied all the four points held by the Pharisees, asserting that there was no resurrection; no rewards and punishments hereafter; no angels, no spirits. They believed there was a God, but denied that he had any special supervision of human affairs (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 22: 23; Acts 23: 8</span></span>). They 
                were the materialists of that day. Considering all God's promises as referring 
                to this world, they looked upon poverty and distress as evidence of God's 
                curse. Hence to relieve the poor was to sin against God in interfering with his 
                mode of government. Far fewer than the Pharisees, they were their rivals in 
                power; for they were the aristocratic party, and held the high-priesthood, with 
                all its glories. Their high political position, their great wealth, and the 
                Roman favor which they courted by consenting to foreign rule and pagan customs, 
                made them a body to be respected and feared</span>) coming to his baptism, he said 
            {therefore to the multitudes that went out to be 
            baptized on him}  unto them (<span class="comm">John spoke principally 
                to the leaders, but his denunciation indirectly included the multitude who 
                followed their leadership</span>), Ye offspring of vipers (<span class="comm">A metaphor 
                for their likeness to vipers--as like them as if they had been 
                begotten of them. The viper was a species of serpent from two to five feet in 
                length, and about one inch thick. Its head is flat, and its body a yellowish 
                color, speckled with long brown spots. It is extremely poisonous (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">(<span class="comm">Acts 28: 6</span></span>). John here uses the word 
                    figuratively, and probably borrows the figure from <span class="style7">Isaiah 59: 5</span></span>). It means that the Jewish rulers were full of guile and 
                malice, cunning and venom. With these words John gave them a vigorous shaking, 
                for only thus could he hope to waken their slumbering consciences. But only one 
                who has had a vision of "the King in his beauty," should presume 
                thus to address his fellow-men. The serpent is an emblem of the devil (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 3: 1; Revelation 12: 9, 14, 15</span></span>), and 
                Jesus not only repeated John's words (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 12: 
                        35; 23: 23, 33</span></span>), but he interpreted the words, and told them 
                plainly that they were "the children of the devil" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 8: 44</span></span>). The Jewish rulers well deserved this name, for they poisoned the religious principles of the nation, and accomplished the crucifixion of the Son of God</span>), who warned you to flee (<span class="comm">John's baptism, like that of Moses at the Red Sea (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 10: 2</span></span>), was a way of escape from destruction, of rightly used. Christian baptism is also such a way, and whosoever will may enter thereby into the safety of the kingdom of Christ, but baptism can not be used as an easy bit of ritual to charm away evil. It must be accompanied by all the spiritual changes which the ordinance implies</span>) from the wrath to come? (<span class="comm">Prophecy foretold that Messiah's times would be accompanied with wrath (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 63: 3- 6; 
                        Daniel 7: 10- 26</span></span>);  but the Jews were all of the opinion that 
                this wrath would be meted out upon the Gentiles and were not prepared to hear 
                John apply the prophecy to themselves. To all his hearers John preached the 
                coming kingdom; to the impenitent, he preached the coming wrath. Thus he 
                prepared the way for the first coming of the Messiah, and those who would 
                prepare the people for his second coming would do well to follow his example. 
                The Bible has a voice of warning and denunciation, as well as words of 
                invitation and love. Whosoever omits the warning of the judgment, speaks but 
                half the message which God would have him deliver. God's wrath is his 
                resentment against sin (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 18: 34;

                By "fruit" or "fruits," as Luke has it, he means the

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> and think not {

                to quiet it</span>), We have Abraham to our father (<span class="comm">The Jews thought 
                that Messiah would rule over them as a nation, and that all Jews would, 
                therefore, be by birthright citizens of his kingdom. They thought that descent 
                from Abraham was all that would be necessary to bring them into that kingdom. 
                John's words must have been very surprising to them. The Talmud is full of 
                expressions showing the extravagant value which Jews of a later age attached to 
                Abrahamic descent. "Abraham," it says, "sits next the gates 
                of hell, and doth not permit any wicked Israelite to go 
                down into 
                it." Again, it represents God as saying to Abraham, "If thy 
                children were like dead bodies without sinews or bones, thy merit would avail 
                for them." Again, "A single Israelite is worth more before God than 
                all the people who have been or shall be." Again, "The world was 
                made for their (<span class="comm">Israel's</span>) sake." This pride was the more inexcusable 
                because the Jews were clearly warned by their prophets that their privileges 
                were not exclusive, and that they would by no means escape just punishment for 
                their sins (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 7: 3, 4; Micah 3: 11; Isaiah 
                        48: 2</span></span>). John repeated this message, and Jesus reiterated it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 8: 11, 12; Luke 16: 23</span></span>). We 
                should note that in this preparation for the gospel a blow was struck at 
                confidence and trust in carnal descent. Birth gives no man any privileges in 
                the kingdom of God, for all are born outside of it, and all must be born again 
                into it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 13; 3: 3</span></span>); yet many 
                still claim peculiar rights from Christian parentage, and infant baptism rests 
                on this false conception. The New Testament teaches us that we are children of 
                Abraham by faith, and not by blood; by spiritual and not carnal descent 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 4: 12-16; Galatians 3: 26; 6: 15; John 8: 39</span></span>). It had been better for the Jews never to have heard 
                of Abraham, than to have thus falsely viewed the rights which they inherited 
                from him</span>): for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to 
            raise up children unto Abraham (<span class="comm">John meant that their being children of 
                Abraham by natural descent gave them no more merit than children of Abraham 
                made out of stone would have. He pointed to the stones along the bank of Jordan 
                as he spoke.</span>)</p>

            (<span class="comm">The Roman Government did not collect its own taxes. Instead of doing so, it 
                divided the empire into districts, and sold the privilege of collecting the 
                taxes in these districts to certain capitalists and men of rank. The 
                capitalists employed agents to do the actual collecting. These agents were 
                usually natives of the districts in which they lived, and those in Palestine 
                were called publicans. Their masters urged and encouraged them to make the most 
                fraudulent and vexatious exactions. They systematically overcharged the people 
                and often brought false accusation to obtain money by blackmail. These 
                publicans were justly regarded by the Jews as apostates and traitors, and were 
                classed with the lowest and most abandoned characters. The system was bad, but 
                its practitioners were worse. The Greeks regarded the word 
                "publican" as synonymous with "plunderer." Suidas 
                pictures the life of a publican as "unrestrained plunder, unblushing 
                greed, unreasonable pettifogging, shameless business." The Turks to-day 
                collect by this Roman method. Being publicly condemned, and therefore 
                continually kept conscious of their sin, the publicans repented more readily 
                than the self-righteous Pharisees. Conscience is one of God's greatest gifts,

(<span class="comm">The term wages included rations and money. The soldiers were not to add to their receipts by pillage or extortion. Soldiers' wages were about three cents a day, so they were exposed to strong temptation. Yet John did not bid them abandon their profession, and become ascetics like himself.

                    of the Jewish courts was limited to excommunication or scourging. The seventy

                    Antipas, by a course of reckless apostasy and unbridled lust, grieved even the religious sense of the hypocrite. Annas and Caiaphas, 
                    impersonators of materialism, sat in the chief seat of spiritual power. Men 
                    might well look for a deliverer, and hasten with joy to hear of a coming King. 
                    But, nevertheless, we could have no more forceful statement of the deep 
                    impression made by John's ministry than that the people were disposed to take 
                    him for the Christ</span>);</p> 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> John answered, saying unto them all,</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 7</span> And he preached, saying,</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 3: 11</span> Iindeed baptize {baptized}  
            you in {with} water unto repentance (<span class="comm">That is, 
                unto the completion of your repentance. Repentance had to begin before the 
                baptism was administered. After the sinner repented, baptism consummated his 
                repentance, being the symbolic washing away of that from which he had repented 
                and the bringing of the candidate into the blessings granted to the 
                repentant (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 1: 4; Luke 3: 3</span></span>): But there {he that} 
                (<span class="comm">John preached repentance because of a coming King; he now announces who the 
                    King is. He pictures this King as, first, administering a different baptism 
                    from his own; second, as a judge who would separate the righteous from the 
                    wicked, just as a husbandman sifts the wheat from the chaff</span>)   
                cometh after me (<span class="comm">Subsequent to me in ministry. But John indicates that 
                    the coming of Christ would be closely coupled with his own appearing. One event 
                    was to immediately follow the other. So Malachi binds together in one time the 
                    appearing of both forerunner and judge </span>(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Malachi 3: 1-3 </span></span>) he that is mightier than I (<span class="comm">mightier both to 
                    save and to punish</span>),  whose shoes (<span class="comm">The sandal 
                    then worn was a piece of wood or leather bound to the sole of the foot to 
                    protect it from the burning sand or the sharp stones. It was the forerunner of 
                    our modern shoe</span>) I am not worthy to bear (<span class="comm">To untie or carry away the 
                    shoe of the master or his guest was the work of the lowest slave of the 
                    household. As a figure of speech, the shoe is always associated with 
                    subjugation and slavery  </span>(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 60: 8</span></span>). John means, "I am not worthy to be his servant." John was simply 
                the forerunner of Jesus; the higher office and honor of being Jesus' attendants 
                was reserved for others (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 11: 
                        11</span></span>): the latchet (<span class="comm">the lace or strap</span>) of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit (<span class="comm">That which is here referred to was foretold by the prophets (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 44: 3; Joel 2: 28</span></span>). In the early church 
                    there was an abundant outpouring of the Spirit of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Titus 3: 5, 6; Acts 2: 3, 4, 17; 10: 44</span></span>) This prophecy began 
                    to be fulfilled on the day of Pentecost (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 1: 5; 
                            2: 4</span></span>). In the choice of the word "baptize" God 
                    indicated through his prophet how full this flooding of the Spirit would be</span>) 
                and in fire (<span class="comm">Many learned 
                    commentators regard the expression "in fire" as a mere 
                    amplification of the spiritual baptism added to express the purging and 
                    purifying effects of that baptism, but the context forbids this, for, (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 3: 10</span></span>),  casting the unfruitful trees 
                    into the fire represents the punishment of the wicked, and, (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 3: 12</span></span>), the burning of the chaff with fire does 
                    the same, and consequently the baptizing in fire of the intervening verse must, 
                    according to the force of the context have the same reference. True, the 
                    expression "he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with 
                    fire," does not separate the persons addressed into two parties, and, if 
                    the context is disregarded, might be understood as meaning that the same 
                    persons were to be baptized in both; yet the context must not be disregarded, 
                    and it clearly separates them</span>):</p>

                In the days of John the Baptist, and in that country at the present day, wheat 
                and other grain was not threshed by machinery. It was beaten out by flails, or 
                trodden out by oxen on some smooth, hard plot of ground called the 
                threshing-floor. These threshing-floors were usually on elevations where the 
                wind blew freely. When the grain was trodden out, it was winnowed or separated 
                from the chaff by being tossed into the air with a fan or winnowing shovel. 
                When so tossed, the wind blew the chaff away, and the clean grain fell upon the 
                threshing-floor</span>) is in his hand (<span class="comm">Ready for immediate work. Both John and 
                Malachi, who foretold John, are disposed to picture Jesus as the judge (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Malachi 3: 2- 5</span></span>) Of all the 
                pictures of God which the Bible gives, that of a judge is the most common and 
                frequent</span>), thoroughly to {and he will 
            thoroughly}  cleanse his threshing-floor (<span class="comm">Removing 
                the chaff is called purging the floor. Humanity is a mixture of 
                good and bad, and to separate this mixture, save the good and destroy the bad, 
                is the work of Christ. He partially purges the floor in this present time by 
                gathering his saints into the church and leaving the unrepentant in the world. 
                But hereafter on the day of judgment he will make a complete and final 
                separation between the just and the unjust by sending the evil from his 
                presence and gathering his own into the garner of heaven  </span>(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 25: 32, 33</span></span>). He shall also winnow our individual 
            characters, and remove all evil from us (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 22: 31, 32; Romans 7: 21- 25</span></span>), and to {and he will} gather the {his} wheat into his {the} garner (<span class="comm">Eastern garners or granaries were usually subterranean vaults or caves. Garnered grain rested in safety. It was removed from peril of birds, storms, blight and mildew. Christians are now on God's threshing-floor; hereafter they will be gathered into the security of his garner</span>); but the chaff (<span class="comm">when the Bible wishes to show the worthlessness and the doom of the ungodly, chaff is one of its favorite figures</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Job 21: 18; Psalm 1: 4; Isaiah 17: 13; Jeremiah 15: 7; Hosea 13: 3; Malachi 4: 1</span></span>) he will burn up (<span class="comm">To prevent chaff from being blown back and mixed again with the wheat, it was burned up. All the chaff in the church shall be consumed on the day of judgment</span> (<span class="comm">1 Corinthians 3: 12, 13</span>), and there shall be no mixing of good and bad after death (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 16: 26</span></span>)  with unquenchable fire (<span class="comm">In this and in other places (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Thessalonians 1: 8, 9; Mark 9: 48; Matthew 25: 41</span></span>), the future suffering of the wicked is taught in the Bible. He 
                shows no kindness to his neighbor, no friendship toward mankind, who conceals 
                the terrors of the Lord. These terrors are set forth in no uncertain terms. 
                Many believe that God will restore the wicked and eventually save all the human 
                race. Others hold that God will annihilate the wicked, and thus end their 
                torment. This passage and the one cited in Mark would be hard to reconcile with 
                either of these views; they indicate that there will be no arrest of judgment 
                nor stay of punishment when once God begins to execute his condemnation. God 
                purged the world with water at the time of the flood; he will again 
                purge it with fire on the day of judgment (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Peter 3: 7- 10</span></span>).</p>
