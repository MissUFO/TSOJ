                    <h1>Man Born Blind</h1>

                    <p>As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who was blind from birth.</p>

                    <p>His <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">12 disciples</a> who were with him asked:</p>

                    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('teacher')">Teacher</a>, whose sin caused this man to be born blind -- his own or his parents?</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>Neither. He was born blind so that the works of God could be displayed in him. We must do the work of he who sent me while it is daytime.</p>

                    <p>The night is coming when no man can work. When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>

                    <p>After Jesus had said these things he spat on the ground and made clay and anointed the man's eyes with it. He told the man to go to the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pool')">pool of Siloam</a>.</p>

                    <p>The man did as Jesus said and came away seeing.</p>

                    <p>The neighbors of the blind man who had known him for a long time and had seen him often begging for a living, said:</p>

                    <p>Isn't this the blind man who sat and begged?</p>

                    <img src="img/siloam2.png" class="img-responsive" name="siloam" title="siloam" />
                    <p>Others said:</p>

                    <p>It is.</p>

                    <p>Others disagreed.</p>

                    <p>But the man himself declared:</p>

                    <p>I am the man.</p>

                    <p>They asked him:</p>

                    <p>How is it that you can now see?</p>

                    <p>He said:</p>

                    <p>The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and told me to go wash at the pool of Siloam. I did what Jesus said, and now I can see.</p>

                    <p>The people asked:</p>

                    <p>Where is Jesus?</p>

                    <p>The man answered:</p>

                    <p>I do not know.</p>

                    <p>The people brought the blind man to the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> to see how they would respond to the man who had been born blind.</p>

                    <p>Jesus did this miracle on the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('sabbath')">Sabbath</a> day.</p>

                    <img src="img/romesidenav.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="romesidenav" title="romesidenav" />
                    <p>So the Pharisees asked the man how he had received his sight. He told them the same story he had told his neighbors.</p> 

                    <p>When they heard this, some of the Pharisees said:</p>

                    <p>This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath day.</p>

                    <p>Other Pharisees said:</p>

                    <p>How is it that a man who is a sinner can do such miracles?</p>

                    <p>So they questioned the blind man again.</p>

                    <p>The man who had been blind said:</p>

                    <p>He is a <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('prophesied')">prophet</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Jews did not believe that the man had actually received his sight. They called his parents and asked them how he had received his sight.</p>

                    <p>His parent answered:</p>

                    <p>Yes this is our son, and he was born blind. But we don't know how he has received his sight. He is old enough, ask him yourself.</p>

                    <p>The parents feared the Jews because they knew that they had already agreed among themselves that anyone who confessed that Jesus was the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('christ')">Christ</a> would be thrown out of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('synagogues')">synagogue</a>.</p>

                    <p>That is why they told the Pharisees to ask their son how he had received his sight.</p>

                    <p>So the Pharisees called a second time for the man who had been born blind. They said to him:</p>

                    <p>Give glory to God, not Jesus, because we know he is a sinner.</p>

                    <p>The man answered:</p>

                    <p>Whether he is a sinner or not I do not know, but I do know one thing, I was blind and now I can see.</p>

                    <p>They said to him, What did he do to you?</p>

                    <p>The man answered:</p>

                    <p>I have told you over and over what he did. Do you want to hear it again? Would you like to become one of his disciples?</p>

                    <p>The Pharisees, after hearing this, reviled the man and said:</p>

                    <p>You are his disciple, but we are <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('lawsofmoses')">disciples of Moses</a>. We know that God spoke to Moses, we don't know who this man is.</p>

                    <p>The man said:</p>

                    <p>Why, here is a real mystery. He opened my eyes and yet you do not know who he is.</p>

                    <p>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a true worshipper of God and does his will, he will listen to that man.</p>

                    <p>Since the world began I have never heard of a man who was born blind who had his eyes opened and received his sight.</p>

                    <p>If Jesus were not from God, he could do nothing.</p>

                    <p>They told him:</p>

                    <p>You were born into sin and you presume to teach us?  They threw him out.</p>

                    <p>Jesus heard that they dismissed from the assembly and he went and found him.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to the man:</p>

                    <p>Do you believe in the Son of God?</p>

                    <p>He answered:</p>

                    <p>Who is the Lord, that I might believe in him?</p>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>You have both seen him and he is the one who is speaking to you right now.</p>

                    <p>The man said:</p>

                    <p>Lord, I believe.</p>

                    <p>The man worshipped him.</p>

                    <p>Jesus summed it up by saying:</p>

                    <p>Judgment came into this world so that those who could not see can now see, and those who can see have become blind.</p>

                    <p>There were Pharisees nearby who heard what Jesus said. They asked Jesus:</p>

                    <p>Are you saying that we are blind?</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>If you were blind, you would have no sin. But because you say that you see, your sin remains.</p>
