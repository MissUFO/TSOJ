                    <p>After this, Jesus appeared to two men as they walked toward Emmaus, a village near Jerusalem.</p>

                    <p>As these two men were talking to each other, Jesus walked up to them. Jesus hid who he was.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>What are you talking about as you walk?</p>

                    <p>They stood still, looking sad.</p>
                    <img src="img/emmaus.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="emmaus" title="emmaus" />
                    <p>One of the men, whose name was Cleopas, answered:</p>

                    <p>Are you the only one in <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('jerusalem')">Jerusalem</a> who does not know what has happened in the past couple of days?</p>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>What things?</p>

                    <p>They answered:</p>

                    <p>The things concerning Jesus the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('nazarene')">Nazarene</a>, who was a prophet, mighty in word and deed before God and all the people.</p>

                    <p>And how the chief <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('priest')">priests</a> and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('crucified')">crucified</a> him. But we hoped that he was the one that was going to redeem Israel.</p>

                    <img src="img/jaffagatemedium.png" class="img-responsive" name="jaffagatemedium" title="jaffagatemedium" />
                    <p>Besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass. And some women of our company amazed us, having gone to the tomb and finding it empty. They saw a vision of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('angel')">angels</a> who said that Jesus was alive.</p>

                    <p>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it empty like the women said.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('prophesied')">prophets</a> have spoken. Wasn't it written that the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('christ')">Christ</a> should suffer all these things, and enter into his glory?</p>

                    <p>And then, beginning from <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('lawsofmoses')">Moses</a> and including all the prophets, he interpreted to them all the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">scriptures</a> and all the things concerning himself.</p>

                    <p>As they came to their village, Jesus began to walk further. The men stopped him and said:</p>

                    <p>Stay with us, for it is getting dark and the day is almost over.</p>	

                    <p>Jesus went with them and stayed with them. When it came time for the meal, he sat down to eat with them and he took bread and blessed it and gave it to them. At that moment their eyes were opened and they saw it was Jesus, and Jesus instantly vanished from their sight.</p>

                    <p>The men said to one another:</p>

                    <p>Didn't our hearts burn within us, while he spoke to us on the road and opened the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">scriptures</a> to us?</p>

                    <p>They got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem and found <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">the 11</a> together and those who were with them (about one hundred and twenty).</p>

                    <p>They told the disciples and the others how Jesus had made himself known to them, but the disciples did not believe. </p>
