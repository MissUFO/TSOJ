        <h6>The slaying of Abel, by the Italian Painter Titian</h6>
        <h1><span>Abel</span></h1>

        <p> Adam and Eve's second son. His older brother Cain killed him in anger. Abel followed God's instructions for sacrificing a lamb.</p>

        <p>Cain was a farmer and offered God produce but God didn't accept it because that wasn't what God told him to do. Cain became jealous of Abel and killed him.</p>

        <p>Abel's sacrifice of the lamb showed that God required a blood sacrifice in order to take care of sin, and was a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, who was the perfect Lamb of God, sacrificed as a blood offering for our sin. </p>
