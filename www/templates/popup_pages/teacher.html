        <h1><span>Teachers</span></h1>

        <p>The word “teacher” usually comes from the Hebrew word, “Rabbi”. Teacher is the term that Jews used to address their religious leaders. Because scribes were the most educated in the scriptures and fulfilled the role of instructing others, they were often addressed as “teacher.”</p>

        <p>Jesus was recognized as a Teacher who stood apart from other teachers. Most teachers would appeal to other teachers or famous scribes to support their statements, while Jesus spoke as one who had authority in himself.</p>
