        <h1><span>Sacrifices & the Lamb of God</span></h1>

        <p>Sacrifices were used a symbol of removing sin from a person's life so they would be acceptable to God.</p>

        <p>The purpose of sacrifices was to show that a deeper relationship with God is possible, but that it requires a need for continual cleansing of sin.</p>

        <p>The sacrifices didn't have any value in themselves, but pointed worshippers forward to the coming of Jesus who would be offered once as the ultimate sacrifice to bear the sins of all the world for all time.</p>

        <p>In the sacrificial system, when people wanted to dedicate themselves or re-establish their relationship to God, they would first admit that imperfections (sin) in their lives made them unacceptable to God.</p>
        <p>They would confess (acknowledge) their sin to God, then lay their hands on the animal that was to be sacrificed as a symbol of identifying with the animal and recognizing that the penalty for sin is death.</p>
        <p>The animal would then be killed, cut up and burned on the altar as an offering to God.</p>
        <p>Sacrifices were established by God as early as Adam and Eve -- when God clothed them with skins of animals and when their son Abel came to offer animals from his flock (Genesis 4: 4).</p>
        <p>Even then, God had planned for Jesus, and all these sacrifices were a symbol of Jesus who would come to offer himself as the perfect sacrifice. We can put our trust in Him, because by dying on the cross, His blood has paid the penalty for our sin. There is no need for any further sacrifice.</p>
        <p>God set up specific rules for sacrificing animals, many of them recorded in the book of Leviticus that Moses wrote about 1,400 years before Jesus lived.</p>
        <p>Even then, a lamb was required for most sin offerings. When Jesus began his public ministry, John the Baptist referred to his as, "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world." (John 1: 29)</p>
        <p>Some people did not raise sheep and were too poor to buy a lamb, so God allowed them to use a dove to sacrifice instead. If they were too poor to buy a dove, they were allowed to offer a small amount of flour. God reached out to all of us, first in the sacrificial system, and then through Jesus, to make a way for our sin to be forgiven so we can enjoy a relationship with God. All he requires is that we confess (acknowledge) our sin and put our trust in Him.</p>
        <p>In the Jewish sacrificial system, God also set up sacrifices to be offered on special occasions, and for repairing relationships with other people.</p>
