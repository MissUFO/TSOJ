        <h1><span>Noah</span></h1>

        <p>Old Testament figure who lived after Adam and before Abraham, probably about 2500 years before Christ.</p>
        <p>In Noah's time, people became so wicked that God sent a flood to kill them all. God warned Noah of the flood, and he believed God even though his neighbors made fun of him for building a huge boat in the middle of the desert.</p>
        <p>The whole earth was covered with water. When it began subsiding, Noah and his wife and his extended family came upon dry land. </p>
        <p>God made the rainbow as a promise to Noah and his descendants that he would never send another worldwide flood.</p>
