        <p><strong>Vinegar</strong> mixed with <strong>myrrh</strong> or <strong>gallâ€“</strong> The vinegar mentioned here was a common sour wine used daily by the Roman soldiers.</p>

        <p>Myrrh and gall both refer to a bitter-tasting substance that is a mild analgesic pain-reliever.</p>

        <p>It was offered to people who were crucified to relieve their pain. Jesus chose to suffer the pain instead.</p>
        <p>It is interesting that myrrh is one of the gifts the magi presented to Jesus when he was a small child.</p>
