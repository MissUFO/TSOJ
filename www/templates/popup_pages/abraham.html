        <h6>Abraham, by the Italian painter Guercino</h6>
        <h1><span>Abraham</span></h1>

        <p>Father of the Jews and Arabs, and the 12 Tribes of Israel.</p>

        <p>God made a covenant (contract) with Abraham that He would cause Abraham's descendants to become a great nation, and through them, everyone in the world would be blessed (Genesis 12: 1-3).</p>

        <p>The ultimate blessing that came through Abraham's descendants was Jesus, who came as God in the flesh to provide a way for everyone in the world for all time to have a relationship with God.</p>

        <p>God also promised to give the land of Canaan to Abraham's descendants (Genesis 17: 8), but at the time, Abraham and his wife Sarah had no children and were both past childbearing age.</p>
        <p>They got impatient, and Abraham had a child with Sarah's servant who was Hagar. The child was named Ishmael. Later, Sarah became pregnant and had Isaac. The Jews are descendants of Isaac and the Arabs are descendants of Ishmael.</p>
        <p><strong>The 12 Tribes of Israel:</strong> God promised Abraham that He would make his descendants a great nation. That promise was passed to Abraham's son <strong>Isaac</strong>, then to Isaac's son <strong>Jacob</strong>.</p>
        <p>Jacob's 12 sons are considered the beginning of the line of each of the twelve tribes of Israel, and each tribe is named after the son from whom it descended.</p>
        <p>However, there is one slight irregularity in this part of the family tree. Jacob had 12 sons, but two of the twelve tribes are named after his grandsons.</p>
        <p>Levi did not get an inheritance of land because his descendants were responsible to assist the priests and maintain the temple, so their inheritance was the tithes and offerings of the people.</p>
        <p>Jacob made Joseph equal with him as a patriarch because Joseph saved their family from famine when he was second in charge in Egypt and invited them to come and live near him in Egypt.</p>
        <p>Jacob made Joseph's two sons Manasseh and Ephraim to each be the head of a tribe.</p>
