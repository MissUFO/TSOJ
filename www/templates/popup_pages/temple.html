        <h1><span>Temple</span></h1>

        <p>A building in Jerusalem that was the only place where Jews could offer sacrifices to meet their religious requirements.</p>

        <p>Solomon built the first one about 900 years before Jesus was born. It was destroyed by invaders, rebuilt on a smaller scale, and then rebuilt by Herod the Great beginning about 18 years before Jesus was born. </p>

        <p>Herod's temple was done on such a grand scale that the main part took 10 years to build and the outer courts weren't completed until 65 years after Jesus' birth. </p>

        <p>Jesus said it would be torn down so that one stone would not remain on top of another. The Romans did just that about 70 years after Jesus was born. </p>
        <p>The temple has not been rebuilt since then, and now there is a Muslim holy place, the Dome of the Rock, that is located on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. </p>
