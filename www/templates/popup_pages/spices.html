        <h1><span>Spices and Ointment for Burial</span></h1>

        <p>Under Jewish burial custom, the body was washed, then wrapped tightly using strips of cloth with a combination of powdered and gummy spices in the folds to hold the cloth in place and make it smell nice out of respect for the person who died</p>
        <p> The body was wrapped from the ankles to the shoulders with a separate cloth for the head.</p>
        <p><strong>Aloes</strong> was probably a gum or perfume extracted from a fragrant wood. The head was often anointed and covered separately.</p>
        <p>The women were in a hurry to bury Jesus before the Sabbath, and they probably wrapped his body and planned to come back later to add more spices and perfume.</p>
        <p>This is another confirmation of the resurrection, because the burial cloths were wrapped tightly with what essentially was glue. It would have been like a body cast from Jesus' ankles to his shoulders. And yet on the third day he was walking around with no grave cloths.</p>
