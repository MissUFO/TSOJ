        <h1><span>Veil of the Temple</span></h1>

        <p>The temple had an inner room called the holy of holies where the presence of God was.</p>
        <p>Once a year on the Day of Atonement, the high priest would enter the inner room to offer a sacrifice for the sins of the nation.</p>
        <p>It was separated from the rest of the temple by a veil or curtain that was seamless and 60 feet high and about six inches thick.</p>
        <p>It was such a serious thing to enter the holy of holies that the Jews developed a practice of tying a rope around the leg of the high priest so that if he died or collapsed for some reason while he was in there, assistants could drag him out without risking their lives by going in after him.</p>
        <p>When Jesus died, the veil ripped in two from top to bottom. It was a miraculous event symbolizing that through Jesus' death, everyone who trusts in Him has access to God, not just the high priest once a year.</p>
