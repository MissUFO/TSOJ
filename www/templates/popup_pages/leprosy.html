        <h1><span>Leprosy</span></h1>

        <p>A disease that eats away at the skin, and eventually the nerves and bones.</p>

        <p>Many lepers lose or damage limbs because when their nerves are damaged, they cut or burn themselves and don't feel it.</p>

        <p>Lepers in Christ's time were required to live outside the city and yell "leper" anytime people came near, so they would not get close.</p>

        <p>There was no known cure. It was even considered by some a judgment of God because, these people said, the leprosy that was visible was an indication of their rotten spiritual condition.</p>
        
        <p>Lepers were left to fend on their own and to die a slow death. Jesus was compassionate to the lepers and showed that he cared about even the people that were considered the lowest on the social scale. He cared about them physically and spiritually.</p>
