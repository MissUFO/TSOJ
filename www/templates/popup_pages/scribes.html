        <h1><span>Scribes</span></h1>

        <p>The word “scribe” is the English translation of the Greek word “Grammateis”, which means “student of the scriptures.”  Scribes were men whose primary occupation was writing out copies of the Jewish Scriptures and teaching the people what the law said.</p>

        <p>Because they copied the Old Testament books, they were familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures and were respected in society for their literacy and knowledge. The scribes provided teaching that was the religious and moral backbone for the Jewish people during the time of Jesus. Because of their role, there were often addressed as, “Teacher.”</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>They were trusted as professional interpreters and as ones who could judge individual cases as they related to Jewish law. Scribes were, therefore, also trusted as lawyers within Jewish society. As the scribes were the most learned individuals on the fine details of following Jewish law, their duties also consisted of deciding on specific questions of the law in individual cases.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Scribes had no authority in themselves, but rather they continually deferred to the authority of other scribes and traditions to support their positions. The scribes were some of Jesus’ most adamant opponents. In their minds, the Messiah who the Old Testament Scriptures spoke about did not seem to match up with who Jesus was.</p>
