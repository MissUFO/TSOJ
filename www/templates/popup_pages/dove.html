        <h1><span>Doves for sacrifice</span></h1>

        <p>Some people did not raise sheep and were too poor to buy a lamb, so God allowed them to use a dove to sacrifice instead. If they were too poor to buy a dove, they were allowed to offer a small amount of flour.</p>

        <p>God reached out to all of us, first in the sacrificial system, and then through Jesus, to make a way for our sin to be forgiven so we can enjoy a relationship with God. All he requires is that we confess (acknowledge) our sin and put our trust in Him.</p>

        <p>In the Jewish sacrificial system, God also set up sacrifices to be offered on special occasions, and for repairing relationships with other people.</p>
