        <p>An affliction or disease.</p>

        <p>When Moses came to Pharaoh to ask him to let the Jews leave Egypt, Pharaoh refused at first, because the Jews were a source of slave labor to him.</p>
        <p>God sent "plagues" on Egypt to convince Pharaoh of his power and to persuade him to let the Jews leave (Read beginning with Exodus 7: 14).</p>
        <p>Many of the plagues showed God's power over gods the Egyptians worshipped, like the first plague turning the Nile into blood and the ninth plague, darkness, showed power over the sun God.</p>
        <p>The tenth plague also showed God's power over Pharaoh's own family when his firstborn son was killed, as was the firstborn in all of Egypt, except for the Jews.</p>
