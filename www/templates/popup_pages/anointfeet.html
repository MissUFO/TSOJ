        <h1><span>Washing feet, and anointing with oil</span></h1>

        <p>Washing feet was commonly done by servants for guests entering a wealthy person's house.</p>
        <p>Most people wore sandals, and the roads were dusty so when travelers arrived, someone would wash their feet.</p>
        <p>Anointing usually involved pouring oil on someone's head or body as a sign of being set apart to be a prophet, priest or king.</p>
        <p>People would also put oil on their bodies to refresh themselves or for medicinal purposes. It was also use to embalm dead bodies.</p>
        <p>When the woman anointed Jesus' feet, she used costly perfume along with her tears and hair.  This was done in light of Jesus impending death on the cross. it can also be seen as a symbol of his being set apart as prophet, priest and king.</p>
