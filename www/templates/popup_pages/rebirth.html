        <h1><span>Rebirth</span></h1>

        <p>Rebirth is when God gives us new spiritual life. It is called rebirth, or being "born again" because first we are born physically, and then by Gods grace we are born spiritually.</p>

        <p>We all begin this life "dead" spiritually because we are both sinners by birth and by practice. Sin separates us from God. Jesus paid the penalty for our sins when he lived a perfect life and died on the cross in order to pay the penalty for our sin and to become the mediator between us and God the Father.</p>

        <p>When we by faith put our trust in Jesus, rather than our own efforts, we are brought into a right relationship with God. When this happens, we enter into eternal life, which means that we know and are known by God the Father, becoming one of his children.</p>
        
        <p>The evidence that we are born again is that the Holy Spirit enters into our life and leads us into truth and enables us to produce “good fruit” including love, joy, peace, patience, and other "fruits of the spirit in our lives (Galatians 5: 22-23).</p>
        <p>We will not choose to pursue a lifestyle of sin as God gives us the power to resist temptation (1 John 3:9; 1Corinthians 10: 13).</p>
        <p>When we do sin we are promised that when we confess the sin that God will forgive us and cleanse us from it. Nowhere in the Bible does it teach that we are forgiven of sins by simply agreeing with God that we are sinners without repenting of the sin and being cleansed of its affect and delivered from its power over us by the power of God. (1 John 1: 9).</p>
        <p>This does not mean that we do not repeat the same sins over and over, but only that true confession abhors the sin and begs God for both forgiveness and deliverance. Deliverance that God promises his people.</p>
        <p>Being reborn into God family always produces the family traits of love, joy, patience, peace, longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness , meekness and self control.</p>
        <p>As long as we are in this mortal body we will struggle with sin and its consequences. The Good News is that Jesus came to save sinners from past, present and future sins and that he indwells us for the purpose of changing us into his likeness.</p>
        <p>One day, when we die in Christ, we will be delivered from the sin that struggles against the new nature that God has put in all his people. We will then live eternally free from both sin and its consequences, and in harmony with our God and Creator, to his everlasting praise and glory.</p>
