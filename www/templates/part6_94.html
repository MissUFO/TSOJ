                    <h1>Jesus Sends Out 70</h1>

                    <p>Now after this, Jesus appointed 70 messengers in addition to the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">12 disciples</a>.</p>

                    <p>He sent them two-by-two into every city and place that he was going to visit.</p>

                    <p>He told them:</p>

                    <p>The harvest is great but the laborers are few. Pray that the Lord of the harvest would send out laborers into the harvest.</p>

                    <p>Go on your way. Look, I am sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves. Do not carry any money, or extra shoes, and don't talk to anyone on the way.</p>

                    <p>Whatever house you enter, first say:</p>

                    <p>Peace be to this house.</p>

                    <img src="img/armageddon.png" class="img-responsive" name="armageddon" title="armageddon" />
                    <p>If you are received then your peace will rest upon that house. If you are not received, then there will be no blessing on that house.</p>

                    <p>Stay in the same house, and eat and drink what they give you, for a laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not go from house to house.</p>

                    <p>Whatever city you enter, receive whatever they put in front of you and eat what you are served.</p>

                    <p>Heal the sick and tell them, The kingdom of God is very near to you.</p>

                    <p>If you go into a city and are not received, then go into the streets and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.  Tell them that the kingdom of God is very near.</p>

                    <p>I tell you that it would be more tolerable for <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('sodom')">Sodom</a> in the day of judgment than for that city.</p>

                    <p>Woe to you, Chorazin!</p>

                    <p>Woe to you Bethsaida! If the mighty works that were done in you were done in Tyre and Sidon they would have <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('repent')">repented</a>, sitting in <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('sackcloth')">sackcloth and ashes</a>.</p>

                    <p>What about Capernaum, will it be exalted to the heavens? Or will it be brought down to <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('hell')">hell</a>.</p>

                    <p>The person who hears you is hearing me, and the person who rejects you is rejecting me.  The person who rejects me, rejects the one who sent me.</p>

                    <p>The 70 went out and did as Jesus had commanded them.  When they returned to Jesus, they were full of joy:</p>

                    <p>Lord, even the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('demon')">demons</a> are subject to us in your name.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>


                    <img src="img/jesusjudea.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="jesusjudea" title="jesusjudea" />
                    <p>I saw <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('satan')">Satan</a> falling as lightning from heaven. Look, I have given you the authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and to trample over all the power of the enemy. Nothing can hurt you.</p>

                    <p>But do not be happy that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.</p>

                    <p>In the same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('holispirit')">Holy Spirit</a> and said:</p>

                    <p>I thank you Father, Lord of heaven and Earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and educated, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for this was well pleasing to you.</p>

                    <p>All things have been given to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is, except the Father and whoever the Son reveals himself to.</p>

                    <p>Turning to the disciples he said privately:</p>

                    <p>Blessed are the eyes that see the things that you see. I tell you this, many prophets and kings have desired to see and hear the things that you have seen, and they didn't see or hear them.
