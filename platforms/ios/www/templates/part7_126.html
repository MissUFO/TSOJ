                    <h1>The Final Judgment</h1>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>The kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who went out to meet the bridegroom.</p>

                    <p>Five of them where foolish and five of them were wise.</p>

                    <p>The foolish virgins took lamps without oil in them. The wise virgins took plenty of oil.</p>

                    <p>While the bridegroom delayed his coming all the virgins nodded off and went to sleep.</p>

                    <p>At midnight the cry went out in the land: </p>

                    <p>Look the bridegroom! Come out and meet him.</p>

                    <p>All the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. But the foolish virgins said to the wise:</p>

                    <p>Give us your oil, our lamps are going out.</p>

                    <p>The wise virgins responded:</p>

                    <p>But then there may not be enough for us; go and buy some more oil for yourselves.</p>
                    <img src="img/almondtree.png" class="img-responsive" name="almondtree" title="almondtree" />
                    <p>While the foolish virgins were out trying to find oil, the bridegroom came and the wedding party entered the house and the doors were shut and locked.</p>

                    <p>After a little time, the five foolish virgins arrived and knocked on the door:</p>

                    <p>Lord, Lord open to us.</p>

                    <p>But the Lord answered and said:</p>

                    <p>The truth is that I do not know you.</p>

                    <p>Be watchful because you do not know the day or the hour of your Lord's coming.</p>

                    <p>It is like when a man goes to another country, but before he goes he calls his servants together and gives them <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('talents')">talents</a>, one five, another two and yet another one, in order to invest and make a profit while he is gone.</p>

                    <p>The one given five talents, traded and made five more talents.</p>

                    <p>The one given two talents, traded and made two more.</p>

                    <p>But the one given one talent hid the Lord's money in the earth.</p>

                    <p>Then one day the Lord returned and called his three servants together for a reckoning with them.</p>

                    <p>He received back the five talents and then another five from the first servant:</p>

                    <p>Well done you good and faithful servant, You have been faithful with a little now I will put you in charge of a lot. Enter into the joy of your Lord.</p>

                    <img src="img/girlflowers2.png" class="img-responsive" name="girlflowers" title="girlflowers" />
                    <p>He received back the two talents and then another two from the second servant:</p>

                    <p>Well done you good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, now I will put you over many things. Enter into the joy of your Lord.</p>

                    <p>He then received back the one talent from the third servant, but no more. The third servant said:</p>

                    <p>I knew that you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter.</p>

                    <p>I was afraid and so I went and hid the talent in the ground.</p>

                    <p>The Lord answered:</p>

                    <p>You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I had not scattered, you should have put the talent into the bank to make interest.</p>

                    <p>Take this wicked servant away and give what he had to the first servant who was has the ten talents.</p>

                    <p>For the one who has will be given more and he will have an abundance.</p>

                    <p>But the one who does not have, even the little he has will be taken away.</p>

                    <p>He cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, where there was weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

                    <p>When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on the throne of glory and gather the nations before him.</p>

                    <p>He will separate them one from another, like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</p>

                    <p>He will put the sheep on one side and the goats on the other side.</p>

                    <p>Then the King will say to the ones on his right side:</p>

                    <p>Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the beginning of the world.</p>

                    <p>I was hungry and you gave me something to eat.</p>
                    <p>I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink.</p>
                    <p>I was a stranger and you took me in.</p>
                    <p>I was naked and you clothed me.</p>
                    <p>I was sick and you visited me.</p>
                    <p>I was in prison, and you came to me.</p>

                    <p>Then the righteous will answer him, saying:</p>

                    <p>Lord, when were you hungry and we fed you?</p>
                    <p>Or thirsty and we gave you drink?</p>
                    <p>When did we see you as a stranger and take you in?</p>
                    <p>Or naked and cloth you?</p>
                    <p>And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?</p>

                    <p>The King answered:</p>

                    <p>Here is a truth that you really need to understand, As you did it to the least of my brothers, you did it to me.</p>

                    <p>Then the King will say to the ones on his left hand:</p>

                    <p>Depart from me, you cursed ones, enter into the fire which is prepared for the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('satan')">devil</a> and his angels.</p>

                    <p>I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat.</p>
                    <p>I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.</p>
                    <p>I was a stranger and you didn't take me in.</p>
                    <p>I was naked and you didn't cloth me.</p>
                    <p>I was sick and you didn't visit me.</p>
                    <p>I was in prison, and you didn't come to me.</p>

                    <p> Here is a truth that you tragically missed. As you didn't do it to the least of my brothers, you didn't do it to me.</p>

                    <p>The wicked will go away into eternal punishment. But the righteous will go into eternal life.</p>
