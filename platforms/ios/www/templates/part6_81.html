                    <h1>Third Withdrawal from Herod's Territory</h1>
                    <h3>A Blind Man Healed</h3>
                    <p>Jesus went immediately into the boat with his disciples and went to the borders of Magadan, which is in Dalmanutha.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('sadducees')">Sadducees</a> found Jesus and began to question him. They wanted Jesus to show them a sign from heaven.</p>

                    <p>Jesus was deeply grieved in his spirit at their unbelief.</p>

                    <p>Jesus told said:</p>

                    <p>Why is this generation looking for a sign? When it is evening you look at the sky and see that it is red, and you predict good weather.</p>

                    <p>In the morning you look at the sky and see that it red and lowering and you predict foul weather.</p>

                    <img src="img/magadan.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="magadan" title="magadan" />
                    <p>You know how to discern the face of the sky and yet you cannot see the signs of the times.</p>

                    <p>An evil and adulterous generation looks for a sign. The truth is that no sign will be given to this generation except the sign of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('jonah')">Jonah</a>.</p>

                    <p>So Jesus left that area and went to the boat and sailed to the other side of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('seaofgalilee')">Sea of Galilee</a> with his <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">12 disciples</a>.</p>

                    <p>The disciples forgot to bring any bread along for the trip. When they mentioned it to Jesus he said:</p>

                    <p>Beware of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('yeast')">yeast</a> of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.  Beware of the yeast of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('herod')">Herod</a>.</p>

                    <p>The disciples, not quite understanding what Jesus was talking about, wondered if he was saying these things to them because they forgot to bring bread.</p>

                    <p>Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them:</p>

                    <p>You have so little faith, why are you worrying about not having any bread? Don't you understand yet?</p>

                    <p>Don't you remember the five loaves and the five thousand it fed, with an abundance left over?</p>

                    <p>Don't you recall the seven loaves and the four thousand it fed with an abundance left over?</p>
                    <img src="img/loneleyplan.png" class="img-responsive" name="loneleyplan" title="loneleyplan" />
                    <p>Why is it that you do not understand that what I am telling you is not about bread.</p>

                    <p>Have your hearts been hardened? Do you have eyes and yet do not see? Do you have ears that do not hear? Don't you remember anything?</p>

                    <p>Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not talking about bread, but that he was warning them to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p>

                    <p>Once they landed on shore, Jesus and his disciples went to Bethsaida -- not the suburb of Capernaum but <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('bethsaida')">Bethsaida Julias</a>, which is a town on the east side of the Jordan river near where it flows into the sea of Galilee.</p>

                    <p>A blind man was brought to Jesus for healing. Jesus took the  man's hand and led him outside the village. Jesus then spit into his eyes and laid his hands on his eyes, and asked:</p>

                    <p>Do you see yet?</p>

                    <p>The man looked up and said:</p>

                    <p>I see men, but they look like walking trees.</p>

                    <p>Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again and when the man opened his eyes everything became perfectly clear.</p>

                    <p>Jesus sent the man to his home and gave him instructions not to enter the village. </p>
