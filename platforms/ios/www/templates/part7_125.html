                    <h1>The Second Coming of Christ</h1>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>But in those days the sun will become dark, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will be shaken, and the powers of the heaven will be shaken.</p>

                    <p>And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, and there will be great agitation in the oceans that will cause men to be perplexed.</p>

                    <p>Men will faint with fear because of the things coming on the world, for the powers of the heaven will be shaken.</p>

                    <p>And then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn.</p>

                    <p>And then they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.</p>

                    <p>He will send out his <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('angel')">angels</a> with the great sound of the trumpet, and they will gather together his elect from everywhere in the universe.</p>

                    <img src="img/oldcityair.png" class="img-responsive" name="oldcityair" title="oldcityair" />
                    <p>But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift your head, because your redemption is coming near.</p>

                    <p>And he spoke a <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('parable')">parable</a> to them.</p>

                    <p>Learn the parable of the fig tree. When her branches become tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.</p>

                    <p>In the same way, when you see all these things coming to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near, even knocking at the door.</p>

                    <p>This is the truth you need to understand. This generation will not pass away until all these things are fulfilled.</p>

                    <p>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</p>

                    <p>But the day and the hour this is going to happen, only the Father knows.</p>

                    <p>It will be like the days of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('noah')">Noah</a> when the Son of man comes.</p>

                    <p>In those days there was eating and drinking and marrying, until Noah entered into the ark. No one knew what was happening until the flood came and swept them away.</p>

                    <p>It will be like this when the Son of man comes.</p>

                    <p>Two men will be in the field, one will be taken and the other will be left behind.</p>

                    <p>Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other will be left.</p>

                    <p>Watch with anticipation, because you do not know the day your Lord is going to come.</p>

                    <p>If the head of the house knew when the thief was going to arrive, he would have been prepared for his coming and prevented his house from being broken into. Be ready, for his coming will be unexpected.</p>

                    <p>Beware that you don't let your hearts become filled with the concerns and cares of this world, or become careless in how you live your life, the day will come like a net enclosing a flock of birds. And it will come on everyone.</p>

                    <p>Blessed is the wise and faithful servant, whom his Lord will find doing his business when he comes.</p>

                    <p>An evil servant says in his heart:</p>

                    <p>My Lord is going to be late.</p>

                    <p>And he begins to misuse his position and mistreat those under him, and lives an evil life full of self indulgence.</p>

                    <p>When the master does come, that servant will have his position and authority given to someone else. And he will go where all the hypocrites go, where there will be gnashing of teeth and weeping without end.</p>

                    <p>Watch and pray so that you might escape all these things and stand before the Son of man. Only the godly are able to stand in his presence.</p>

                    <p>Watch and pray for you do not know when the Lord is going to come.</p>
