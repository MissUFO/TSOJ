                    <h1>Jesus Arrives at Bethany</h1>

                    <p>The <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('passover')">Passover</a> of the Jews was very near. Many went  to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify themselves.</p>

                    <p>The people were looking for Jesus and wondering out loud if he would come to the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('feast')">feast</a>.</p>

                    <p>They knew that the religious leaders were actively looking for the opportunity to arrest him.</p>

                    <p>Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived in <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('bethany')">Bethany</a>.</p>

                    <p>Bethany was where Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead and was very near <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('jerusalem')">Jerusalem</a>.</p>

                    <p>When Jesus was in Bethany, they made a supper for him in the house of Simon the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('leprocy')">leper</a>. Martha served the dinner, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead, was there.</p>

                    <p>While Jesus was sitting for the meal, Mary Magdelene carried an alabaster jar of exceedingly costly <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('perfumedoil')">perfume</a> and broke it and poured it over the head of Jesus.</p>


                    <img src="img/bethanydistant.png" class="img-responsive" name="bethanydistant" title="bethanydistant" />
                    <p>She then <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('anointfeet')">anointed his feet</a> with the expensive perfume and wiped it with her hair. This was the second time that Mary had done this.</p>

                    <p>The house was filled with the smell of the ointment.</p>

                    <p>But Judas Iscariot, one of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">12 disciples</a> and the one who would betray Jesus, said:</p>

                    <p>Why wasn't this ointment sold for the great amount of money it would bring, and the money given to the poor?</p>

                    <p>Others at the party began to criticize Mary.</p>

                    <p>Jesus heard this said:</p>

                    <img src="img/jesusjudea.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="jesusjudea" title="jesusjudea" />
                    <p>Leave her alone. She is pouring this ointment upon my body in preparation for my burial.</p>

                    <p>The poor you have with you always, and you can do good to them whenever you want.</p>

                    <p>The truth is that wherever the good news is preached, what Mary has done today will be spoken about in memorial to her.</p>

                    <p>The common people, meanwhile, learned where Jesus was and they came to see him and Lazarus.</p>

                    <p>But the chief <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('priest')">priests</a> were conspiring to put Lazarus to death.</p>

                    <p>They hated Lazarus and wanted to destroy him. Because of him, many had believed in Jesus. </p>
