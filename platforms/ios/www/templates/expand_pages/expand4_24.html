        <h3>FIRST MINISTRY IN JUD&AElig;A.</h3>
        <h3><span class="comm">(<span class="comm">JUD&AElig;A AND &AElig;NON.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 3: 22-36.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> After these things came Jesus and his disciples 
            into the land of Jud&aelig;a (<span class="comm">That is, he left Jerusalem, the capital of 
                Jud&aelig;a, and went into the rural districts thereof. We find him there again 
                in <span class="style7">John 11</span>. and <span class="style7">Luke 13-18</span>. He gained disciples there, 
                but of them we know but few, such as Mary, Martha, Lazarus, Simeon, and Judas 
                Iscariot</span>); and there he tarried with them (<span class="comm">It is not stated how 
                long he tarried, but it may have been from April to December, for the passover 
                was in April, and December was "yet four months" before the 
                harvest--<span class="style7">John 4: 35</span></span>), 
            and baptized. (<span class="comm">This baptism was not into the three names of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 7: 39</span></span>), into which the apostles were 
                afterwards directed to baptize (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 28: 19</span></span>). It was a continuation of John's baptism, preparatory to the 
                organization of the church--a preparation for the kingdom. Some think that 
                Jesus, at this time, baptized in his own name, and afterwards gave the full 
                baptismal formula into the other two names--Father and Spirit. But there 
                is no evidence of this, and Christian baptism is a baptism into the death of 
                Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 6: 3</span></span>). Christ would hardly 
                have ordered baptism into his death before his crucifixion. Such a proceeding 
                would have wrought confusion.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span>  And John also was baptizing (<span class="comm">The fact 
                that John also was baptizing is a further indication that the baptism 
                administered by Jesus was 

                preparatory. There would hardly be two 
                kinds of baptism administered by divine consent at one time</span>) in Aenon 
            (<span class="comm">This name means "springs"</span>) near to Salim, because there was 
            much water there (<span class="comm">If one starts at Sychar, at the foot of Mount Ebal, and 
                follows the Damascus road northward for seven miles, he comes upon the valley 
                called Wady Farah. In this beautiful wady the stream flows eastward, having 
                Salim three miles to its south and 'Ainun four miles to its north. For the most 
                part the valley is narrow, and hemmed in by rocky cliffs. But if one follows 
                the course seven miles eastward from the Damascus road, he comes upon a 
                beautiful valley, about one mile wide and three miles broad--a place every 
                way suitable for the gathering of multitudes to hear the preaching of John. A 
                perennial stream, with copious springs all along its course, furnishes, even in 
                the longest, driest summers, the "much water" required for 
                baptism</span>): and they came, and were baptized. (<span class="comm">"Here, 
                then," says Lieutenant Conder, "in the wild, desert valley, beneath 
                the red precipices, where the hawk and kite find nests in 'the stairs of the 
                rocks', or by the banks of the shingly stream, with its beautiful oleander 
                blossoms shining in the dusky foliage of luxuriant shrubs, we may picture the 
                dark figure of the Baptist, in his robe of camel's hair, with the broad leather 
                Bedawi belt around his loins, preaching to the Jud&aelig;an multitude of pale 
                citizens--portly, gray-bearded rabbis, Roman soldiers in leathern armor 
                and shining helmets, sharp-faced publicans, and, above all, to the great mass 
                of oppressed peasantry, the 'beasts of the people', uncared for, stricken with 
                palsy, with blindness, with fever, with leprosy, but eagerly looking forward to 
                the appearance of that Messiah who came to preach the gospel to the 
                poor."</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span>  For John was not yet cast into prison. (<span class="comm">John's Gospel 
                shows that the ministry of Christ was well under way before that of the Baptist 
                ceased: a fact which the synoptists do not reveal.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span>  There arose therefore 
            a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying. 
            (<span class="comm">What this questioning was we are not told. The word "therefore" 
                doubtless refers to 

                the baptisms just mentioned, so that the 
                dispute probably related to the necessity or purifying effects of that 
                ordinance. But whatever the dispute was about, it brought to notice the fact 
                that Jesus was baptizing more than John, a fact which some of the disciples of 
                John quickly resented.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span>  And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, 
            he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, 
            the same baptizeth, and all men come to him (<span class="comm">This verse shows that John's 
                disciples looked upon Jesus as one who owed all his position and popularity to 
                the Baptist's testimony, and were, therefore, surprised to find that Jesus was 
                surpassing John. They looked upon this conduct as a species of ingratitude on 
                the part of Jesus. This verse also shows us that the witness of John did not 
                pass unheeded. His witness was public and notorious, and men remembered it, 
                though they did not always profit by it. That these friends of John felt 
                unkindly toward Jesus is shown by their exaggerated statement that "all 
                men come to him."</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span>  John answered and said, A man can receive 
            nothing, except it have been given him from heaven. (<span class="comm">Some take this to mean 
                that Jesus could not have had this great success unless Heaven gave it to him; 
                but it is more likely that John used the words with entire reference to 
                himself. A man can only take what is given to him; the Son of God takes 
                what he chooses. The friend receives only what hospitality extends to him, but 
                the heir takes what he will, as the owner of the house.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said (<span class="comm">In stating that John had borne witness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 3: 26</span></span>) John's disciple had already 
                committed themselves to the fact that John disclaimed to be the Messiah, and 
                that Jesus was the Messiah; for it was concerning these two things that John 
                had given his testimony</span>), I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent 
            before him. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is made full. (<span class="comm">John looks upon the body of disciples as the Lord's bride, and prophetically anticipates the very title which was subsequently applied to the church. It was the duty of &quot;the friend of the bridegroom&quot; to arrange the preliminaries of the wedding, and to promote the mutual interests of the bride and bridegroom. His duties and responsibilities greatly exceeded those of our &quot;best man,&quot; for it was his place to demand the hand of the bride, and to prepare everything for the reception of the bride and bridegroom. Joy at the sound of the bridegroom's voice is part of the drapery of John's figure. Voices of bride and bridegroom are a Biblical symbol of festivity and joy (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 7: 34; 25: 10; 33: 11</span></span>). The Song of Solomon is the only book in the Bible which dwells upon the relationship of bride and bridegroom, and in it the voice of the bridegroom is mentioned with joy (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Song of Solomon 2: 
                        8</span></span>). If John meant anything more by the phrase than mere drapery, he 
                used it to express his pleasure that the Messiah was directing his own affairs 
                and speaking his wishes with his own voice, instead of using his friend as a 
                mouthpiece.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> He must increase, but I must decrease. (<span class="comm">Noble words! &quot;He must increase&quot;--because the divine law has ordered it, and prophecy has foretold it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 52: 13</span></span>), and because the very divinity of his nature absolutely requires it. "I 
                must decrease"--in popularity, in power, in following. The Christian 
                minister finds the increase of his work the same as the increase of Christ's 
                kingdom; but with the Baptist the case was different. He was a Jewish prophet, 
                and as the power of the New Dispensation, under Christ, gained headway, the Old 
                Dispensation, of which he was a part, waxed old, and was ready to vanish away.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span>  He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the 
            earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above 
            all. (<span class="comm">Some think that the testimony of the Baptist closes with the 
                thirtieth verse, and that the rest of 
                the chapter is the comment of the apostle John, but there is certainly no 
                sufficient ground for such a view.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness. (<span class="comm">In <span class="style7">John 3: 31, 32</span> the Baptist draws a contrast between his testimony and that of the Messiah. The Baptist's testimony was largely of a negative character. He testified that he was not the Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 3: 28</span></span>), and while he pointed Jesus 
                out as the Christ, the worthy one, the spiritual baptizer, he nowhere undertook 
                to elaborate as to the character or nature of Jesus. He looked upon Jesus as 
                being so far above all earthly prophets that no prophet could reveal him. The 
                task of such revelation devolved upon Jesus himself. God must be self-revealed. 
                It was no heavy disappointment to John that his disciples had failed to grasp 
                his testimony concerning himself, and yet so few were persuaded by the 
                testimony of Jesus that John hyperbolically says "no man receiveth his 
                witness."</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> He that hath received his witness hath set his seal 
            to this, that God is true. 
            (<span class="comm">We have here a metaphor, taken from the sealing of a document, as an 
                expression of trust in or adherence to it. Compare 
                <span class="style7">John 6: 27; 1 Corinthians 9: 2</span>. To receive Christ's witness was to publicly confess a conviction that God was true--true to his promise that he would send a Messiah, a Saviour (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 3: 4</span></span>). To believe Christ is to believe God; to make Christ a liar is to make the Father one also, for he speaks concerning Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 5: 10</span></span>) and through Christ--<span class="style7">John 7: 16; 16: 24</span>.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure. (<span class="comm">To give anything by measure indicates a partial, scanty bestowal (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ezekiel 4: 16</span></span>). The Spirit of God, even in inspired prophets, was but a partial and intermittent gift (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 7: 25; 13: 9; 1 Peter 1: 11; Hebrews 1: 1</span></span>), but in Jesus, the Son of God, the Spirit of God dwelt fully and 
                uninterruptedly (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">Colossians 1: 19</span></span>). The 
                present tense, "giveth," points to a continuous communication of 
                the Spirit. If Christ had received the Spirit "by measure," then 
                his gift of the Spirit might be exhausted.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. (<span class="comm">This fact was afterwards asserted by Jesus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 28: 18</span></span>). Jesus is indeed King of kings--<span class="style7">Psalm 2: 6-8; 
                    Matthew 11: 27; Acts 2: 33; 10: 36; Ephesians 1: 22</span>.</span>) <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life (<span class="comm">the New Testament represents everlasting life as a present possession obtained by belief</span>); but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. (<span class="comm">In the second clause of this verse &quot;obeyeth&quot; stands in contrast with &quot;believeth&quot; in the first clause. No mental assent, however strong, is reckoned by the Scriptures as faith unless it results in obedience (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 2: 20; Romans 1: 5</span></span>). 
                "Wrath of God" is a strong phrase, and is not to be lightly 
                explained away. The unconverted sinner rests under this wrath. His study should 
                be not only to avert a sentence to be pronounced at some future day, but to be 
                freed from one already resting upon him. This verse shows conclusively that 
                Christ's atoning work had its divine as well as its human side; that God had to 
                be propitiated as truly as man had to be reconciled. The Baptist had already 
                repeatedly warned the Jewish people of wrath to come if they rejected the 
                Messiah, and in this, his last recorded utterance, he boldly reiterates that 
                warning.</span>)</p>
