        <h3>54. HEALING THE CENTURION'S SERVANT.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT CAPERNAUM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 8: 1, 5-13;  LUKE 7: 1-10.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 1</span> After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of 
            the people,  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 1</span> And when he was come down from the 
            mountain, great multitudes followed him.  he entered 
            into Capernaum. (<span class="comm">Jesus proceeded from the mountain to Capernaum, which was 
                now his home, or headquarters. The multitudes which are now mentioned for the 
                third time were not wearied by his sermon, and so continued to follow him. 
                Their presence showed the popularity of Jesus, and also emphasized the fact 
                that the miracles which followed the sermon were wrought in the presence of the 
                vast throngs of people.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And when he was entered 
            into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion (<span class="comm">The context shows that 
                this centurion or captain of a hundred men was a Gentile, but whether he was in 
                the employ of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, or an officer in the Roman 
                army, is 

                not clear, neither is very important. The army of 
                Antipas, like that of other petty kings, was modeled after that of Rome</span>),



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 2</span> And a certain centurion's servant (<span class="comm">slave 
                boy</span>), who was dear unto him, was sick, and at the point of death.


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And when he heard concerning Jesus (<span class="comm">The sequel shows that the 
                centurion had probably heard how Jesus had healed the son of his 
                fellow-townsman--<span class="style7">John 4: 46-54</span></span>), he sent unto him elders of the Jews (<span class="comm">To 
                reconcile Matthew and Luke, we have only to conceive of the centurion as coming 
                to the edge of the crowd about Jesus, but modestly refraining from coming into 
                the Lord's immediate presence.</span>) asking him that he would come and save his 
            servant.  beseeching him, 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 6</span> and saying, 
            Lord, my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
            (<span class="comm">Because palsy is not usually accompanied with suffering, some think that in 
                this case it was combined with tetanus or lockjaw, a combination not infrequent 
                in hot climates. But Sir R. Bennet, M.D., speaks thus: "In this instance 
                we have probably a case of progressive paralysis, attended by muscular spasms, 
                and involving the respiratory movements, where death is manifestly imminent and 
                inevitable. In such a case there would be symptoms indicative of great 
                distress, as well as immediate danger to life." As to palsy generally, 
                see pp. 175, 183.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 4</span> And they, when they came to 
            Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this 
            for him; 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our 
            synagogue. (<span class="comm">The centurion evidently believed in and worshiped God, but, 
                influenced probably by his profession, did not become a proselyte by being 
                circumcised and conforming entirely to the Mosaic law. He was what later Jews 
                would have termed a Proselyte at the Gate, and not a full-fledged Proselyte of 
                Righteousness. The ruins of Capernaum show the ruins of a synagogue. It was a 
                beautiful structure, built of white limestone, shows by its architectural 
                features that it was built in the time of the Herods, and there is little doubt 
                that it is the one which this pious Gentile erected, and in which Jesus taught 


                and healed.</span>)  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 7</span> And he saith to him
            (<span class="comm">i. e., answering him as represented by his friends</span>), I will 
            come and heal him.  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 6</span> And Jesus went with 
            them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to 
            him,  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 8</span> And the centurion answered and 
            said, {saying unto him,} Lord, trouble not thyself: 
            for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof (<span class="comm">not because his 
                house was a poor one, for he was evidently well to do</span>): 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 7</span> wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed. (<span class="comm">The centurion, well knowing that it was unlawful for Jews to go into the houses of the Gentiles, lest they should sully the sanctity which they desired to maintain, wished to spare Jesus any embarrassment. Whatever he may have thought of this custom with regard to the Pharisees, he attributed to Jesus so high a degree of sanctity that he accepted the doctrine as true in reference to him. The centurion showed his great faith partly by believing that Jesus could heal by a word, but chiefly in his lofty conception of Jesus as compared with himself. The less faith we have, the less we esteem Jesus, and the more faith we have, the less we esteem ourselves. As Jesus rises, we sink in the scale of our estimation. The centurion's faith would have been wonderful enough in an Israelite, but it was all the more wonderful when found in the bosom of a Gentile. The word &quot;found&quot; suggests that Jesus came seeking faith: he will come seeking it again (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 18: 8</span></span>). The 
                elders, little knowing the wideness of our Lord's vision and sympathy, supposed 
                that Jesus would look upon the splendid synagogue erected for the Jewish people 
                as a sufficient motive for granting their request. Even the apostles were slow 
                to learn that at heart Jesus knew neither Jew nor Gentile.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers, and 
            I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to 
            my servant (<span class="comm">not a soldier, but a household slave</span>), Do this, and 
            he doeth it. (<span class="comm">Having those over him, he knew how to obey, and 

                having those under him, he knew how to be obeyed. He was familiar, therefore, 
                with all the principles of obedience. Knowing from the healing of the 
                nobleman's son, or from other reports concerning Jesus, that the realm of 
                nature obeyed Jesus, he judged from his knowledge of earthly obedience that 
                Jesus had those who could come and go for him, and who could carry his messages 
                and enforce obedience to them. He felt that the presence of Jesus was not at 
                all necessary to the healing.</span>)   

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9 </span>And when Jesus heard it, {these things,} he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto them the multitude that followed him, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. (<span class="comm">To some it seems strange that Jesus could marvel, but he had all the actual feelings of a man. However, we should note that Jesus is never said to have marveled but twice. In this case it was because of belief, and in the other (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 6: 6</span></span>), it was because of unbelief. Those who think that Jesus 
                gave or gives faith should note this fact. If Jesus had given the centurion 
                faith, he could not have been surprised to find that he had it; and, if he 
                failed to bestow it upon the people of Nazareth, it would have been 
                inconsistent in him to express surprise at their lack of it. It would seem, 
                however, irreconcilable with the character and affectionate nature of Christ, 
                to bestow faith in such profusion upon this Gentile stranger, and withhold 
                every spark of it from his near kinsmen and fellow-townsmen. Faith is no 
                miraculous gift. Faith means no more nor less than belief; and a man believes 
                the Scripture facts in the same manner and by the same processes that he 
                believes any other facts.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 11 </span>And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven (<span class="comm">Jesus here predicts the conversion of the Gentiles, since that fact is suggested to him by the faith of this centurion. The east and the west represent the extreme points of the compass in the directions in which the world was most thickly inhabited. But Jesus refers rather to spiritual separation than to geographical distances--<span class="style7">Malachi 1: 11; Isaiah 49: 19; Jeremiah 16: 19; Zecheriah 8: 22</span>.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> but the sons of the kingdom (<span class="comm">The child of anything in Hebrew phraseology expressed the idea of special property which one has in the thing specified, as, for instance, children of disobedience (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 2: 2</span></span>). Jesus here means, then, the Jews, to whom the kingdom belonged by hereditary descent--<span class="style7">Romans 9: 4</span></span>) shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. [<span class="comm">In this paragraph Christ's kingdom is set forth under the simile of a great feast, a familiar simile with Jesus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 26: 29; Luke 22: 30</span></span>). The Jews were accustomed to speak of the delights of the Messianic kingdom as a feast with the patriarchs (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 14: 15</span></span>), but lost sight of the fact that Gentiles should share in its cheer and fellowship (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 25: 6</span></span>). Marriage feasts and other great feasts of the Jews were usually held in the evening. Inside, therefore, there would be joy and light and gladness, but outside there would be darkness and disappointment, tears and bitter self-reproach (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 25: 10-13</span></span>). The despised outcasts should be brought in and placed at the festal board, while the long-invited guests--the natural and fleshly heirs of Abraham's invitation--would be excluded (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 21: 43</span></span>). Hell is absence from spiritual 
                light, separation from the company of the saved, lamentation and impotent 
                rage.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast 
            believed, so be it done unto 
            thee. And the servant was healed in that hour. (<span class="comm">In the moment when Jesus 
                spoke, the servant was healed--not relieved, but healed.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 7: 10</span> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the 
            servant whole. (<span class="comm">The centurion, long before this when he was building the 
                synagogue, had doubtless heard with delight concerning the wonderful works 
                wrought by the mighty prophets in the olden time; he little dreamed that his 
                own eyes should see them all surpassed.</span>)
