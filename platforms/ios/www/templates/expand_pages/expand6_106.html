        <h3>106. TEN LEPERS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">BORDERS OF SAMARIA AND GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 17: 11-37.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5"></span> 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And it came to pass, as they were on their way to 
            Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee. 
            (<span class="comm">If our chronology is correct, Jesus passed northward from Ephraim about forty 
                miles, crossing Samaria (<span class="comm">here mentioned first</span>), and coming to the border of 
                Galilee. He then turned eastward along that border down the wady Bethshean 
                which separates the two provinces, and crossed the Jordan into Per&aelig;a, 
                where we soon find him moving on toward Jericho in the midst of the caravan of 
                pilgrims on the way to the passover.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off. (<span class="comm">One may still meet such groups of lepers outside the villages. They do not stand directly in the road so as to make an actual meeting, but are off to one side and near enough to beg. The law required lepers to keep away from the rest of the people (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 13: 45, 46</span></span>). The 
                rabbis are said to have prescribed a fixed distance at which lepers must keep, 
                but authority varies as to this distance, some giving it as 

                a rod, and others as high as a hundred paces</span>): 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> and they lifted up their 
            voices (<span class="comm">such as they had, for the leper's bronchial tubes are dry, and the 
                voice is harsh and squeaky</span>), saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on 
            us. (<span class="comm">Considering their condition, their prayer was definite enough.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> 
            And when he saw them (<span class="comm">the disciples about him probably at first obstructed 
                the Lord's view</span>), he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the 
            priests. (<span class="comm">See p. 180.</span>) And it came to pass, as they went, they were 
            cleansed. (<span class="comm">They received the blessing when they showed their faith by their 
                obedience.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back (<span class="comm">like Naaman--<span class="style7">2 Kings 5: 15</span></span>), with a loud voice (<span class="comm">made strong by health and 
                gratitude</span>) glorifying God; 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> and he fell down on his face at 
            his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. (<span class="comm">On his way to the 
                priests at Mt. Gerizim the Samaritan turned back to express his thanks. 
                Apparently nine of the lepers were Jews. A Samaritan was among them because 
                they were along the border of his country, and because the fellowship of 
                affliction and disease obliterated the distinctions of race, as it does to this 
                day. In the leper-houses at Jerusalem Mohammedans and Jews now live together 
                despite the rancor existing between the healthy representatives of these two 
                religions.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And Jesus answering said, Were there not the ten cleansed? 
            but where are the nine? (<span class="comm">The Lord publicly noted the indifference and 
                ingratitude of the nine and the thanksgiving of the tenth. As we look around 
                to-day and see how many are ungrateful for the blessings which they receive, 
                the words ring like an echo in our ears.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> Were there none found that 
            returned to give glory to God, save this stranger? (<span class="comm">It sometimes happens 
                that we receive most where we expect least. Though the Samaritan's religion was 
                partly Jewish, yet by blood he was a foreigner, as the word 
                "stranger" means.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy 
            way: thy faith hath made thee whole. (<span class="comm">Thus Jesus emphasized the fact that 
                the blessing came through faith, encouraging the man to seek 

                higher blessings by the same means.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And being asked by the Pharisees, 
            when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God 
            cometh not with observation: 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> neither shall they say, Lo here! or, There! for, lo, the kingdom of God is within you. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 14: 17</span>. The question of the Pharisees was doubtless a covert criticism. More than three years before this Jesus had begun to say that the kingdom of heaven was at hand; and they thought that after all this preparation it was high time that the kingdom should commence. They were looking for some manifestation of the sovereignty of God in the realm of the civil and the external, which would raise the Jewish nation to conspicuous supremacy, but they are told that the work of the kingdom is internal and spiritual (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 3: 8; 18: 36; Romans 10: 8; Colossians 1: 27</span></span>), and that its effects are not such as can be located in space. They were seeking honors and joys, and would find contempt and sorrow (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Amos 5: 18-20</span></span>). Some have 
                thought it strange than Jesus should say "within you" when 
                addressing the Pharisees, but the word "you" is used generally and 
                indefinitely.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And he said unto his disciples (<span class="comm">giving them 
                instructions suggested by the question of the Pharisees</span>), The days 
            will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and 
            ye shall not see it. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, 
            here! go not away, nor follow after them:



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 26: 13; 2 Thessalonians 2: 8</span>. If the Pharisees looked eagerly for a sensuous external Messianic kingdom, so also would the disciples be tempted in the days to come to cherish a somewhat similar yearning. Knowing that Jesus was to come again to rule in power and in great glory, they would, under the stress of persecution, hunger to see one of the days of his rule. This longing for the coming of the Christ is frequently expressed (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Philippians 4: 5; Titus 2: 13; James 5: 7-9; Revelation 22: 20</span></span>). In their 
                restless eagerness the 

                unwary disciples would be tempted to follow 
                the false Messiahs who excited widespread admiration and attention. Against all 
                this Jesus warns them, telling them that when the kingdom of heaven does at 
                last assume a visible shape in the manifestation of its King, that 
                manifestation will be so glorious, universal and pronounced as to be absolutely 
                unmistakable.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of 
            this generation. (<span class="comm">Thus when he speaks of his glory Jesus is careful to 
                mention the humiliation and suffering which precedes it, that the faith of his 
                disciples may not be weakened by false expectations and misunderstandings. The 
                day of glory was not for that generation, since it would reject him.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> And as it came to pass in the days of Noah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 7: 11-23</span></span>), 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> They ate, they drank, they married, 
            they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and 
            the flood came, and destroyed them all. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 19: 15-28; Ezekiel 16: 46-56; Jude </span></span>); they ate, 
            they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> 
            but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from 
            heaven, and destroyed them all: 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed. (<span class="comm">Our Lord here gives us two historical incidents of the false security of the ungodly, and in doing so he endorses them as real history. The antediluvians and the citizens of Sodom discharged the business of the day and laid their plans for to-morrow and had no thought of evil or anticipation of trouble down to the very moment that the bowls of wrath were poured upon them. Despite all warnings, they were taken by surprise when completely off their guard. The coming of Christ shall be a like surprise to the people of the last day (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 24: 44; Luke 12: 39; 1 Thessalonians 5: 2; 2 Peter 3: 10; Revelation 3: 3; 16: 15</span></span>), and it shall be a day of like punishment--<span class="style7">2 Thessalonians 1: 6-10</span>.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> In that day, 
            he that shall be on the housetop. (<span class="comm">the flat roofs of Oriental houses 

                are used much the same as we use porches</span>), and his goods in 
            the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the 
            field likewise not return back. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Remember Lot's wife. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 19: 26; Luke 9: 62</span>.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. (<span class="comm">See p. 416.</span>) (<span class="comm">It seems strange that the terrors of the last day should be accompanied by any thought or concern for property, but such is the plain intimation of the text. If our hope has been centered upon earthly things, we will be found seeking them even in that hour, just as the face of Lot's wife was turned toward Sodom despite the glare of the penal fires. Our earthly characters become fixed, and great catastrophes do not change them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 22: 10-12</span></span>). If in that hour we be found 
                seeking to save our carnal treasures, it will be a sign that we have lost the 
                spiritual from our lives and have no heavenly treasures.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> I say unto you, 
            In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and 
            the other shall be left. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> There shall be two women grinding together (<span class="comm">making meal or flour with the little stone hand-mills, as they still do in the East</span>); the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. (<span class="comm">Day and night exist simultaneously upon the earth, and the Lord's coming will be at noon to some and at midnight to others. His saints will be found mingled with the rest of the people and engaged in duties befitting the hour. But the Lord will receive them to himself as his own (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 14: 3; 1 Thessalonians 4: 17</span></span>), and they will be ready to be detached from their worldly ties that they may go to meet and welcome the bridegroom at his coming--<span class="style7">Matthew 25: 6, 7</span>.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And they answering say unto him, Where, 
            Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body 
            is, thither will the eagles also be gathered together. (<span class="comm">The 
                disciples desired to know where this manifestation and division would take 
                place, looking upon it as a local prediction. Jesus gave a proverbial answer, 
                the meaning of which is that sin courts and draws to itself punishment and 
                destruction just as a carcass draws winged 

                scavengers. Applying his words, we may say that as the corruption of the antediluvians drew upon 
                them, the devastation of the flood, and as the crimes of the Sodomites called 
                down upon them, the fires from heaven, and as the unbelief of the Jews of 
                Christ's day caused the destruction of Jerusalem and the death of the nation, 
                so the wickedness of the men of the last times will result in the ending of the 
                world. The word translated eagles is generic, and included the vultures also 
                (<span class="comm">Pliny Nat. His. 9: 3</span>). It is likely that the Revision Committee retained the 
                word "eagles" instead of vultures because of the mistaken notion of 
                Lightfoot and others that our Lord here makes a covert allusion to the eagles 
                which were borne upon the Roman standards. A passage similar to the latter part 
                of this section is found at 
                <span class="style7">Matthew 24: 17-41</span>.</span>)
