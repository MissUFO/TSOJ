        <h3>ANNOUNCEMENT TO JOSEPH</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT NAZARETH, B.C. 5</span>).</h3>
        <h3>VERSE MATTHEW 1.18-25.</h3>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> Now the birth (<span class="comm">The birth of Jesus is to handled 
                with reverential awe. We are not to probe into its mysteries with presumptuous 
                curiosity. The birth of common persons is mysterious enough (<span class="comm">--see <span class="style7"> Ecclesiastes 9: 5; Psalm 139: 13-16</span></span>), and we do 
                not well, therefore, if we seek to be wise above what is written as to the 
                birth of the Son of God</span>) of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother 
            Mary had been betrothed (<span class="comm">The Jews were usually betrothed ten or twelve 
                months prior to the marriage. So sacred was this relationship that 
                unfaithfulness to it was deemed adultery, and was punishable by 
                death--death by stoning (<span class="comm">--see <span class="style7">Deuteronomy. 22: 
                        23-28; Leviticus 20: 10; Ezekial 16: 38; John 8: 5</span></span>). Those 
                betrothed 

                were regarded as husband and wife, and could only be 
                separated by divorcement. Hebrew betrothals set the world a good example. Hasty 
                marriage is too often followed by hasty repentance. "No woman of Israel 
                was married unless she had been first espoused"</span>) to Joseph, before 
            they came together (<span class="comm">Before Joseph brought his bride to his own house. An 
                espoused maiden lived in her father's house until the marriage, as is our own 
                custom</span>] she was found with child of the Holy Spirit (<span class="comm">The two evangelists 
                (<span class="comm">Matthew and Luke</span>) which give the earthly genealogy of Jesus are each careful 
                to mention his miraculous conception through the Holy Spirit (<span class="comm">comp. 
                    <span class="style7">Luke 1: 35</span></span>). All New Testament writers recognize 
                Jesus as at once both human and divine. Christ's physical nature was 
                begotten of the Holy Spirit, but the Christian's spiritual nature is 
                begotten of him (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">John 1: 13</span></span>). The act 
                of the Holy Spirit in this case indicates that he is a personality, and not a 
                mere influence, as some are disposed to imagine. Influences do not create 
                physical bodies.</span>) </p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man (<span class="comm">As a 
                righteous man he could not complete his marriage, and thus stain his family 
                name. As a merciful man he did not wish to openly disgrace the one to whom he 
                was so fondly attached. He wished to act justly toward his own reputation, and 
                mercifully toward the reputation of Mary</span>), and not willing to make 
            her a public example (<span class="comm">he did not wish to expose her to the shame of a 
                public trial before the court, nor to punish her as the law permitted</span>), 
            was minded to put her away privily (<span class="comm">The law of Moses gave the husband 
                the power of divorce (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">Deuteronomy. 24: 1</span></span>). 
                The bill or writing certifying the divorce usually stated the cause, and was 
                handed to the wife in the presence of witnesses. Joseph evidently intended to 
                omit stating any cause in the bill, that there might be no record to convict 
                her of shame. The law of divorce applied to betrothed as well as to married 
                persons. In his kindness Joseph anticipates the special teaching of Christ 
                (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">Matthew 19: 8</span></span>)and the general 
                instruction of Paul (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">Galatians 6: 1 </span></span>). How 
                different the conduct of the innocent Joseph from that of guilty Judah 

                (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">Genesis 38: 24</span></span>). Judah 
                needed some one to point out his unfitness--see 
                <span class="style7">John 8: 7</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> But when he thought on these things (<span class="comm">God 
                guides the thoughtful, not the unthinking</span>), behold, an angel of the 
            Lord appeared unto him (<span class="comm">The Lord looks after the good name of those who 
                honor his name, and he serves those who serve him (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">1 Samual 2: 30; John 12: 26</span></span>). The sufferings of both Mary and 
                Joseph must have been very extreme at this time--one being forced to 
                suspect the chief object of his affections, and the other being compelled to 
                rest under the unjust suspicions of loved ones, because of a condition which 
                God alone could explain. But God does explain where we can not understand 
                without his revelation, and where we absolutely need to know</span>) in a dream 
            (<span class="comm">A mode of communication frequently used by God (<span class="comm"> <span class="style7">Genesis 20: 3; 31: 11, 24; 37: 5; 41: 1; 1 Kings 3: 5; Daniel 7: 1; Job 
                        4: 13-15</span></span>). It is difficult to say how men determined between 
                ordinary and divine dreams, but doubtless the latter came with a glory and 
                vividness which gave assurance of their supernatural nature. Matthew mentions 
                four divine dreams, viz.: this one; the second one given to Joseph (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">Matthew 2: 12</span></span>); the dream of Pilate's 
                wife--
                <span class="style7">chapter 27: 19</span></span>), 
            saying, Joseph (<span class="comm">We are known to angels, and they address us by name 
                (<span class="comm">
                    <span class="style7">Acts 10: 3, 13; 27: 24</span></span>). Much more 
                does the Lord know our names--see
                <span class="style7">John 10: 3; Luke 
                    19: 5</span></span>), thou son of David (<span class="comm">the name of David was 
                calculated to waken the memories of God's promises, and helped to prepare 
                Joseph to receive the wonderful news that Messiah was about to be born, for 
                Messiah was the promised heir of David</span>), fear not to take unto thee 
            Mary thy wife (<span class="comm">Have no fear as to Mary's virtue and purity. Fear no 
                disgrace in taking her. Joseph feared as a son of David that this marriage 
                would sully his genealogy. But it was that which gave point and purpose to an 
                otherwise barren and uninteresting record. He feared as a man lest he should 
                share Mary's apparent disgrace; but he had infinitely more reason to fear his 
                unworthiness to share with her the exalted responsibilities of parentage to our 


                Lord</span>): for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy 
            Spirit.</p>


        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> And she shall bring forth a son (<span class="comm">the angel does not 
                say "shall bear thee a son," as he said to 
                Zacharias--see <span class="style7">Luke 1: 13</span></span>); 
            and thou shalt call his name JESUS (<span class="comm">Joseph was to take the position of a 
                legal father to the child and name it. The name means "Salvation of 
                Jehovah" or "Jehovah is the Saviour." Would we could all bear 
                our names, such as Christian, pastor, magistrate, father, mother, child, etc., 
                as Jesus bore that wonderful and responsible name of Saviour</span>); for it 
            is he that shall save his people from their sins (<span class="comm">Thus from before his very 
                birth-hour the nature of Christ's salvation is fully set forth. He came to save 
                from the guilt of sin by having shed his blood, his may be remitted or washed 
                clean. He saves from the power of sin by bestowing the gift of the Spirit, who 
                regenerates, comforts, and strengthens, and ultimately he saves from the 
                punishment of sin by giving us a resurrection from the dead, and an abundant 
                entrance into the home of glory. That is no salvation at all which fails to 
                free us from this triple bondage of sin.</span>)





        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> Now all this is come to pass, 
            that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord (<span class="comm">It was not 
                fulfilled because predicted, but was rather predicted because sure to take 
                place. Prophecies are fulfilled in four ways, namely, 1. When a thing clearly 
                predicted comes to pass. 2. When that which has been pictured in type and 
                shadow is at last shown forth in substance and reality. 3. When an event which 
                has been described in language more elevated and elaborate than it demands is 
                followed by another similar event to which the said language is more perfectly 
                suited. 4. When parabolic or figurative language may be applied to some 
                subsequent event. The prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled after the third fashion, 
                which was spoken by the Lord. In innumerable passages the divine origin and 
                inspiration of the Scriptures are clearly and unmistakably set forth. The same 
                Spirit which foretold through 

                the lips of the prophet now 
                interprets the foretelling through the lips of the angel</span>) through the 
            prophet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 7: 14. </span>Isaiah's name is not given. The ancients were studious readers, and had few books, so that there was little need to cite authors by name</span>), saying (<span class="comm">About the year 740 B.C. While Ahaz was king of Judah, his land was threatened with an invasion by the united armies of Syria and Israel. Isaiah came to frightened Ahaz, promised divine aid, and told Ahaz to seek from God a sign confirming this promise. This Ahaz refused to do; whereupon Isaiah replied that God would grant a sign anyway. The sign was that a virgin should have a son, and before the son reached the age of discretion, the kingdoms of Syria and Israel should be destroyed. The sign given Ahaz was one of deliverance, and prefigured the birth of Christ, the great Deliverer, in four ways: 1. A virgin bearing a child. 2. A male child (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 12: 5</span></span>). 3. The divinely ordered 
                naming of the child. 4. The significance of the name given. Jesus fulfilled in 
                his ministry man predictions; but many more such as this one were fulfilled 
                upon him without his volition,</span>) 



        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> Behold, the virgin shall be with 
            child (<span class="comm">The Sonship of Jesus demands a miraculous birth. If we doubt the 
                miracle of his conception, we can never solve the perplexing problem of his 
                marvelous life and death</span>), and shall bring forth a son, and they 
            shall call his name (<span class="comm">rather, title; under the head of "name" 
                the titles of Jesus are also set forth at <span class="style7">Isaiah 9: 
                    6</span></span>) Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us (<span class="comm">Nature 
                shows God above us; the Law shows God against us; but the Gospel shows God with 
                us, and for us. The blessing of the church militant is Christ, God with us; 
                that of the church triumphant is Christ, us with God. In this world Jesus 
                walked "with us" in human form (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 
                        1: 14</span></span>); and because he did so, we, in the world to come, shall walk 
                "with him" in divine form (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 3: 
                        2; 1 Corinthians 15: 49</span></span>). In a personal sense Jesus may fitly be called 
                "God with us," for he was God and man united in one body.</span>)



        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> 
            And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded 
            him. (<span class="comm">he followed the instructions, though contrary to his first 
                inclination. Blessed are they who 

                permit God to guide them. As 
                Joseph appears to have acted at once upon the angel's instruction, the marriage 
                must have taken place several months prior to the birth of Jesus</span>), 
            and took unto him his wife (<span class="comm">thus becoming the legally recognized father of 
                Jesus, and though he bestowed upon Jesus but a humble name (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 4: 22; Matthew 13: 55</span></span>), he nevertheless 
                rescued him from the reproach of an illegitimate birth</span>);




        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> and knew 
            her not till she had brought forth a son (<span class="comm">Romish teachers contend for the 
                doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, that she may be regarded as an 
                object of worship. This doctrine can not be proved by Scripture. But there are 
                weightier reasons than this which forbid us to worship her; namely, it can not 
                be proven from Scripture either that she was divine or that she was 
                sinless. Moreover, the fact that she entered the marital state at all, 
                shows that she was perfectly human, and comported herself as such</span>): 
            and he called his name JESUS. (<span class="comm">Two Old Testament heroes bore the name Jesus 
                under the form of Joshua. One was captain of Israel for the conquest of Canaan, 
                the other was high priest of Israel for rebuilding the Temple (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Zechariah 6: 11, 12</span></span>). Christ was both the Captain of 
                our salvation and the High Priest of our profession.</span>)
