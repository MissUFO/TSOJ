        <h3>82. RETURN TO GALILEE.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 17: 22-23;  MARK 9: 30-32;  LUKE 9: 43-45.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 9: 30</span> And they went forth from thence (<span class="comm">from the 
                region of C&aelig;sarea Philippi</span>), and passed through Galilee (<span class="comm">on 
                his way to Capernaum</span>); and he would not that any man should know 
            it. (<span class="comm">He was still seeking that retirement which began on the journey to 
                Tyre. See page 399. This is the last definite mention of that retirement, but 
                we find it referred to again at <span class="style7">John 7: 3-4</span>. See page 439.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> For he taught his disciples 
            (<span class="comm">the reason for his retirement is here given: he wished to prepare his 
                disciples for his passion</span>), and said unto them, The Son of man is 
            delivered up (<span class="comm">the present tense is used for the future to express the 
                nearness and certainty of the event</span>) into the hands of men,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 17: 22</span> And {But}  
            while they abode in Galilee,  while all were 
            marvelling at all the things which he did,  Jesus
            said unto his disciples,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 44</span> Let these sayings 
            sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of 
            men. (<span class="comm">We have here two notes of time during which Jesus spoke of his 
                passion. It was all the while he was in Galilee, between his return from 
                C&aelig;sarea and his departure into Jud&aelig;a, for which see page 439. The 
                length of time suggests that the sad lesson was oft repeated, but was at a time 
                when the marvels of his works strengthened the faith of the disciples so as to 
                enable them to bear the instruction.</span>)   and they shall kill 
            him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again. {and the third day he shall be raised up.} (<span class="comm">For comment on 
                similar language see page 306.</span>) And they were exceeding sorry. (<span class="comm">Peter's 
                experience taught them not to attempt to correct Jesus while thus speaking, so 
                there was nothing left for them but to grieve at his words.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> But they understood not this {the} 
            saying,  and it was concealed from them, that they 
            should not perceive it (<span class="comm">What was told to them was not for their present but 
                their future benefit, and therefore they were left to puzzle over the words of 
                Jesus</span>); and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. (<span class="comm">Not 
                so much from any awe with which they regarded him, as from the delicacy of the 
                subject itself, and their own sorrow, which shrank from knowing it more fully.</span>)
