        <h3>145. ANGELS ANNOUNCE THE RESURRECTION.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JOSEPH'S GARDEN. SUNDAY, VERY EARLY.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 28: 1-8;  MARK 16: 1-8;  <br>LUKE 24: 1-8, 12;  JOHN 20: 1-10.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> But  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> Now 
            late on the sabbath day, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 28: 1</span> And when the sabbath was past,  on the first day of 
            the week, {as it began to dawn toward the first
            day of the week,}  at early dawn,  while it was yet dark, cometh 
            {came}  Mary Magdalene early  and the other Mary  
            the mother of James, and Salome,  unto the tomb, bringing {brought}  the spices which they had prepared. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 56.</span></span>) to see the sepulchre.  that they might come and anoint him.  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And behold, there was a 
            great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and 
            rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> His appearance was as 
            lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> and for fear of him 
            the watchers (<span class="comm">the Roman soldiers on guard</span>) did quake, and became as dead 
            men. (<span class="comm">The angel sat upon the stone that the Roman guards might make no 
                attempt to reclose the tomb.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 16: 2</span> And very early on 
            the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the 
            stone from the door of the tomb? </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 2</span> And 
            they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 16: 4</span> and looking up, they see { (<span class="comm">Mary Magdalene</span>) seeth}  that the stone is rolled back: {taken away from the tomb.} for it was 
            exceeding great. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 3</span> And 
            they  entering into the tomb, {entered in,} and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. (<span class="comm">John mentions Mary Magdalene alone, though she came with the rest of the women. As she was the one who reported to John and Peter, he describes her actions, and makes no mention of the others.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 20: 2</span> She runneth therefore, 
            and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and 
            saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not 
            where they have laid him. (<span class="comm">Though Mary came with the other women, she 
                departed at once, while the others tarried, as the sequel shows. The narrative 
                proceeds to tell what happened to the other women after Mary had departed.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 4</span> And it came to pass, while they were perplexed 
            thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel: they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a 
            white robe; and they were amazed.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> and 
            as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto 
            them, {he the angel} answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye;
            Be not amazed:  for I know that ye 
            seek Jesus,  the Nazarene, who hath been crucified:
            Why seek ye the living among the dead? </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 28: 6</span> He is not here, but {for} he is risen, 
            even as he said.  remember how he spake unto you when 
            he was yet in Galilee, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 7</span> saying that the Son of man must be 
            delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day 
            rise again. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And they remembered his words (<span class="comm">For the words 
                referred to, <span class="style7">Matthew 17: 22, 23. </span>. The angel continues his speech as follows</span>),  
            Come,  behold, the place where they laid him!
            see the place where the Lord lay. (<span class="comm">Here is a double 
                wonder, that men should put the Son of God in a grave, and that he should 
                consent to be put there.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 28: 7</span> But {7 And} go quickly, and tell his disciples, 
            and Peter,  He is risen 
            from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see 
            him:  as he said unto you.  lo, 
            I have told you. (<span class="comm">The women were told to hasten, for the disciples were not 
                to endure their sorrow a moment longer than was needful. Peter was mentioned by 
                name that he might know that he was not cast off for his denial. The Lord 
                appeared to some chosen few in Jud&aelig;a, but the large body of his disciples 
                were to see him in Galilee; see Section 152. Jesus had 
                appointed a place of meeting; but we are not told where it was nor when he 
                appointed it.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And they departed quickly  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 16: 8</span> And they went out, and fled from the tomb;  
            with fear and great joy (<span class="comm">fear, because of the heavenly messengers; joy, 
                because of their message</span>), and ran to bring his disciples word.
            for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they 
            said nothing to any one; for they were afraid. (<span class="comm">They told none whom they 
                met, but reserved the message for the apostles.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 12</span> But Peter  therefore  
            arose,  went forth, and the other disciple, and they 
            went toward the tomb.  and ran unto the tomb (<span class="comm">John 
                shows that he and Peter started for the tomb as soon as they received the 
                message of Mary Magdalene given above, but Luke is less exact, blending her 
                message with that of the other women, as will be seen in the latter part of Section 146.</span>);  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 20: 4</span> And 
            they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter (<span class="comm">it is 
                generally accepted that John was younger, and hence more active than Peter</span>)
            , and came first to the tomb;</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> and stooping and looking 
            in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb;
            and stooping and looking in, he seeth  
            and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying;  by 
            themselves;  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> and the napkin, that was 
            upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by 
            itself.  and he departed to his home, wondering at that 
            which was come to pass. (<span class="comm">The impulsive, thoroughgoing nature of Peter was 
                not content with a mere look; he entered the tomb, neither 
                reverence nor awe keeping him out. The sight which he saw puzzled him. Why 
                should those who removed the body pause to unswathe it? why should they 
                unswathe it at all? why should they fold the napkin and place it aside so 
                carefully? But Peter left the tomb with these questions unsolved.</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who 
            came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> For as yet 
            they knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> So the disciples went away again unto their own home. (<span class="comm">Assured that the 
                grave was now empty, and emboldened by the example of Peter, John now 
                enteredit, and as he looked upon its evidences of quietude and order, the truth 
                flashed upon his mind that Jesus himself had removed the bandages, and had 
                himself departed from the tomb, as the firstborn from the dead. Here, then, was 
                the first belief and the first believer in the resurrection; it is important to 
                note that the Scripture did not suggest the fact, but the fact illumined the 
                Scripture.<span class="style7"> Psalm 16: 10 and Isaiah 53: 10</span>, and many other passages set forth the resurrection of our Lord; his own 
                words, too, had plainly foretold it, yet among the disciples it was so much 
                beyond all expectation that the prophecies had no meaning until made clear by 
                the event itself. Yet these are the men whom the Jews accused of inventing the 
                story of a resurrection!</span>)</p>
