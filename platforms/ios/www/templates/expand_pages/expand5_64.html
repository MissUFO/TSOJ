        <h3>64. BARREN FIG-TREE.</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 13: 1-9.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span>  Now there were some present at that very season 
            (<span class="comm">At the time when he preached about the signs of the times, etc. This phrase, 
                however, is rather indefinite--<span class="style7">Matthew 12: 1; 14: 1</span></span>) who told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had 
            mingled with their sacrifices.  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span>   And he answered and said unto 
            them, Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, 
            because they have suffered these things? 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span>   I tell you, Nay: but, 
            except ye repent, ye shall all in like manner perish. (<span class="comm">While Jesus spoke, 
                certain ones came to him bearing the news of a barbaric act of sacrilegious 
                cruelty committed by Pilate. It may have been told to Jesus by enemies who 
                hoped to ensnare him by drawing from him a criticism of Pilate. But it seems 
                more likely that it was told to him as a sample of the corruption and iniquity 
                of the times. The Jews ascribed extraordinary misfortunes to extraordinary 
                criminality. Sacrifice was intended to cleanse guilt. How hopeless, therefore, 
                must their guilt be who were punished at the very times when they should have 
                been cleansed! But the Jews erred in this interpreting the event. Quantity of 
                individual sin can not safely be inferred from the measure of individual 
                misfortune. It was true that the Galil&aelig;ans suffered because of sin, for 
                all suffering is the result of sin. But it was not true that the suffering was 
                punishment for unusual sinfulness. Our suffering is often due to the general 
                sin of humanity--the sin of the whole associate body of which we are a 
                part. History, of course, says nothing of Pilate's act here mentioned. Pilate's 
                rule was marked by cruelty towards Jews, and contempt for their religious views 
                and rites.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span>  Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and 
            killed 

            them, think ye that they were offenders above all 
            the men that dwell in Jerusalem?  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span>    I tell you, Nay: but, except ye 
            repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (<span class="comm">Of this instance, also, there is no 
                other historic mention. It, too was a small incident among the accidents of the 
                day. The pool of Siloam lies near the southeast corner of Jerusalem, at the 
                entrance of the Tyrop&aelig;an village which runs up between Mt. Zion and 
                Moriah. The modern village of Siloam probably did not exist at that time. What 
                tower this was is not known. As the city wall ran through the district of that 
                fountain, it may possibly have been one of the turrets of that wall. This 
                instance presents a striking contrast to the slaughter of which they had told 
                him, for it was, 1. Inflicted upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and 2. It came 
                upon them as an act of God. And Jesus therefore concludes that all shall 
                likewise perish, he pronounces upon the entire people--Jews and 
                Galil&aelig;an alike--a punishment made certain by the decree of God. It 
                is significant that the Jewish people did, as a nation, perish and lie buried 
                under the falling walls of their cities, and the debris of their temple, 
                palaces, and houses. But the word "likewise" is not to be pressed 
                to cover this fact.</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span>   And he spake this parable (<span class="comm">this parable is 
                closely connected with <span class="style7">verses 3 and 5</span> of this 
                chapter, and <span class="style7">verses 58 and 59</span> of the 
                preceding chapter</span>); A certain man had a fig tree planted 
            in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span>   And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking 
            fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the 
            ground? (<span class="comm">It cumbered the ground by occupying ground which the vines should 
                have had, and by interfering with their light by its shade, which is very 
                dense.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span>   And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year 
            also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it (<span class="comm">a common method of treating 
                the fig-tree to induce fruitfulness</span>):  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span>   and if it bear fruit 
            henceforth, well: and if not, 
            thou shalt cut it down. (<span class="comm">In this parable Jesus likened his hearers to a 
                fig-tree planted in a choice place--a vineyard, 

                the odd 
                corners of which are still used as advantageous spots for fig-trees. There is 
                no emphasis on the number three, and no allusion to the national history of the 
                Jews, as some suppose. It simply means that a fig-tree's failure to bear fruit 
                for three years would justify its being cut down. Those to whom Jesus spoke had 
                been called to repentance by the preaching both of John and of Jesus, and had 
                had ample time and opportunity to bring forth the fruits of repentance, and 
                deserved to be destroyed; but they would still be allowed further opportunity.</span>)
