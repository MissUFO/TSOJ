        <h3>92. MAN BORN BLIND.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 9: 1-41.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4">(<span class="comm">Some look upon the events in this and the next section as occurring at the 
                Feast of Tabernacles in October, others think they occurred at the Feast of 
                Dedication in December, deriving their point of time from <span class="style7">John 10: 22</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> And 
            as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. 
            (<span class="comm">The man probably sought to waken compassion by repeatedly stating this fact to 
                passers-by.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this 
            man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? (<span class="comm">They assumed that all 
                suffering was retributive, and asked for whose sins this man suffered, 
                regarding it as a case of extreme hardship, for to be born blind is uncommon, 
                even in the East. Their question had reference to the doctrine of 
                transmigration of souls, the man being regarded as possibly having sinned in 
                some pre-existing state.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor 
            his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
            (<span class="comm">Jesus found a third alternative to their dilemma. The man's parents were 
                sinners, but neither their sin nor the beggar's own sin had caused this 
                calamity. It had come upon him as part of God's plan for his life; it was part 
                of the providential arrangement by which God governs the world.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> We must 
            work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no 
            man can work. (<span class="comm">As to the duration of his earthly works, Jesus classifies 
                himself with his disciples, for his humanity, like ours, had its season of 
                activity, or day, which was practically terminated by the night of death. After 
                his resurrection, Jesus performed no miracles of healing.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> When I am in 
            the world, I am the light of the world. (<span class="comm">In the spiritual sense, Christ is 
                ever the light of the world, but while he lived among men, even the privileges 
                of physical light were imparted to him.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> When he had thus spoken, he spat 
            on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the 
            clay.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (<span class="comm">which 
                is by interpretation, Sent</span>). (<span class="comm">Jesus probably used the clay to aid the man's 
                faith. His so doing gave the Pharisees a chance to cavil at Jesus for breaking 
                the Sabbath. If later rabbis report correctly, the traditions of that day, clay 
                might be put on the eyes for pleasure on the Sabbath, but not for medicine, nor 
                might the eyes be anointed with spittle on that day. As 

                to the pool of Siloam, see page 327. It was probably called Sent because its waters 
                are sent to it from the Virgin's Fountain through a tunnel cut through the hill 
                Ophel. For the Virgin's Fountain, see page 194.</span>) He went away therefore, and 
            washed, and came seeing. (<span class="comm">He did not come back to Jesus, but came to his 
                own house.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> The neighbors therefore, and they which saw him aforetime, 
            that he was a beggar, said, is not this he that sat and begged?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. (<span class="comm">The conclusion 
                of the neighbors is very natural. Such a cure would slightly change his 
                appearance, but in any event the impossibility of the cure would raise doubts 
                as to the identity of the cured.</span>) He said, I am 
            he.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> They said therefore unto him, How then 
            were thine eyes opened? (<span class="comm">They question as to the manner, not as to the 
                fact.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed 
            mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went and washed, and 
            I received sight. (<span class="comm">He speaks of Jesus as one well known. He had learned who 
                sent him before he went to Siloam. We shall note how opposition enlarges the 
                faith and the confession of this man.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And they said unto him, Where is 
            he? He saith, I know not.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> They bring to the Pharisees him that 
            aforetime was blind. (<span class="comm">They wanted to see how the Pharisees would deal with 
                Jesus' miracles. See McGarvey's "Credibility," page 112 f.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened 
            his eyes. (<span class="comm">Such conduct on the Sabbath raised legal questions of which the 
                Pharisees were also the recognized judges.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> Again therefore the Pharisees 
            also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay 
            upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. (<span class="comm">The Pharisees ascertained no more 
                than the neighbors had learned.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> Some therefore of the Pharisees said, 
            This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, 
            How can a man that is a sinner do 

            such miracles? And there 
            was division among them. (<span class="comm">The cause for division is apparent. One party 
                laid stress upon the Jewish tradition and judged Jesus a sinner because he had 
                violated them. The other party laid stress upon the sign or miracle and argued 
                that one who could do such things could not be a violator of God's laws.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> They (<span class="comm">both parties</span>) say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest 
            thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? (<span class="comm">Each party asked the opinion of 
                the blind man, hoping to get something to aid their side of the 
                argument--one party trusting to the man's gratitude, and the other to his 
                fear of the rulers.</span>) And he said, He is a prophet. (<span class="comm">A far more 
                pronounced confession than that which he gave in <span class="style7">John 9: 11</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, 
            that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the 
            parents of him that had received his sight.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> and asked them, 
            saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now 
            see? (<span class="comm">The man's advocacy of Jesus as prophet suggested to those cunning 
                diplomats that there was collusion between Jesus and the man, and that the cure 
                was fraudulent. They therefore denied the cure and sent for the parents, to 
                whom they put the threefold question as to sonship, blindness and cure.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was 
            born blind (<span class="comm">thus they answer clearly as to the first two points</span>):

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask 
            him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself. (<span class="comm">The emphasis in this verse 
                lies in the pronouns. Thus the parents timidly declined to answer the third 
                point, alleging that their son is old enough to answer for himself.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had 
            agreed (<span class="comm">informally</span>) already, that if any man should confess that him
            to be Christ, he should be put out 
            of the synagogue. (<span class="comm">The parents, having heard the unrestrained, freely 
                spoken account given by their son as to his healing, had 

                no doubt 
                in their own minds as to who effected that healing. They therefore declined to 
                speak because of fear, and not through lack of knowledge.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> Therefore said 
            his parents, He is of age; ask him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> So (<span class="comm">following the 
                suggestion of the parents, and because a miracle could not now be denied</span>) 
            they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory 
            to God: we know that this man is a sinner. (<span class="comm">Taken in their English sense, 
                these words would mean, "praise God and not Jesus for what has been 
                done," but the phrase "give God the praise" is, in Hebrew 
                usage, an adjuration to a criminal to confess his guilt (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Joshua 7: 9; 1 Samuel 6: 5</span></span>). The idea may then be paraphrased 
                thus: confess that you and Jesus have conspired to work a pretended miracle. It 
                is your best course, since we know all about the frauds of Jesus and will soon 
                unearth this one.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know 
            not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. (<span class="comm">As to the 
                doings of Jesus, whether fraudulent or not, he could not answer, but he could 
                say that there was no sham or deception about his eyesight.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> They said 
            therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> He 
            answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye 
            hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? (<span class="comm">Perceiving that their 
                boasted knowledge as to the frauds of Jesus was untrue, and that they were even 
                then questioning him to obtain material to be used against Jesus, he declines 
                to repeat his statement and shows them that he understands their sinister 
                motive in questioning him by ironically asking them if they wished to become 
                disciples of Jesus.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his 
            disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> We know that God hath 
            spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is. (<span class="comm">In 
                Jewish estimation, Moses stood next to God. To forsake Moses for another 
                prophet was to be an apostate. Such reviling was a severe test, but the man 
                stood it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> The man answered and 

            said unto them, Why, 
            herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes. (<span class="comm">The man 
                answers contempt with contempt; with biting irony he declares that the miracle 
                of his healing is no wonder at all when compared with the fact that such 
                wonderfully learned men should be totally ignorant of so great a miracle-worker 
                as Jesus. Thus he scorned their superlative claim to infallible knowledge, 
                expressed in <span class="style7">John 9: 24, 29</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> We know (<span class="comm">he takes up their style of speech</span>) that God heareth not 
            sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he 
            heareth. (<span class="comm">Such was the teaching of the Old Testament--<span class="style7">Proverbs 15: 29; Isaiah 1: 15; Micah 3: 4; James 5: 16-17</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Since the world began it was never heard that any one 
            opened the eyes of a man born blind. (<span class="comm">The Old Testament contains no record 
                of such a miracle; the case stood alone as a marvel of power.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> If this 
            man were not from God, he could do nothing. (<span class="comm">He draws the same conclusion 
                which the better element of the Pharisees had drawn. See <span class="style7">John 9: 16</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast 
            altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? (<span class="comm">They give here the Jewish 
                answer to the question asked in <span class="style7">John 9: 2</span>. Do you, so stamped a sinner from birth, presume to teach us, the heads of Israel? They had been denying that he had been blind; they now inconsistently taunt him with blindness as an evidence of his sin.</span>) And they cast him out. (<span class="comm">The vast majority of commentators take this as an immediate act, and hence allege that the language refers to his being cast out of the hall or place where they were assembled, and not to his being excommunicated. Their reason for this is found in the fact that the man could not be excommunicated without a formal meeting of the Sanhedrin. But there is nothing to show that the act was not a deliberate one, including a formal meeting, etc. We agree with DeWette that his expulsion from a hall &quot;would not be important enough to occasion <span class="style7">John 9: 35</span>.&quot;</span>)<p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> Jesus heard that they had cast him 
            out (<span class="comm">His was a sad plight, indeed. To be put out of the synagogue 

                was to be put on a level with the heathen, and to be left without a 
                country or a religious fellowship</span>); and finding him, he said, Dost 
            thou believe on the Son of God? (<span class="comm">Being cut off from all that came through 
                Moses, Jesus was leading him into all that came through the Son of God.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? (<span class="comm">The 
                form of the man's question showed that he regarded a knowledge of the Son of 
                God as a privilege beyond all hope or expectation, and the reply of Jesus is 
                suited to this idea.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, 
            and he it is that speaketh with thee. (<span class="comm">Thus the unhoped for had been 
                actually and sensually realized. To the outcast of the synagogue here and to 
                the outcast of the nation at Jacob's well (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 4: 26</span></span>), how fully Jesus revealed himself!</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> And he said, Lord, 
            I believe. And he worshipped him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> And Jesus said (<span class="comm">not 
                addressing anyone in particular, but rather as summing up the whole incident</span>)
            , For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; 
            and that they that see may become blind. (<span class="comm">The life course of Jesus 
                attracted the needy and repelled the self-satisfied, and was therefore a 
                continuous judgment. Those conscious of their deficiencies and ready to ask for 
                light received it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 9: 36-38</span></span>), while those satisfied with their own opinion became daily more blinded by 
                their bigotry. See <span class="style7">John 9: 24, 34; Matt. 11: 25</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> Those of the Pharisees who were with him (<span class="comm">not as 
                disciples, but for curiosity's sake</span>) heard these things, and said unto him, 
            Are we also blind?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye 
            should have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth. (<span class="comm">If you 
                were conscious of your spiritual darkness, and sought light, you either find it 
                or not be blamed for your failure to do so. They could see if they would, and 
                were responsible for their blindness.</span>)
