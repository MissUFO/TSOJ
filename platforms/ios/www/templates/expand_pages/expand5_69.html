        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 9: 18</span> While 
            he spake these things unto them (<span class="comm">while he talked about fasting at Matthew's 
                table</span>), behold, there came, {cometh}
            a man named Jairus, {Jairus by 
            name;}  and he was a ruler {one of the rulers} of the synagogue (<span class="comm">He was one of the board of elders 
                which governed the synagogue at Capernaum. These elders were not necessarily 
                old men--<span class="style7">Matthew 19: 16-22; Luke 18: 18-23</span></span>), and seeing him,  
            he fell {falleth}  down at 
            Jesus' feet,  and worshipped him (<span class="comm">It was a very 
                lowly act for the ruler of a synagogue thus to bow before the Man of Nazareth. 
                But the ruler was in trouble, and his needs were stronger than his pride</span>)
            ,  and besought him to come into his house; 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 42</span> for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was 
            dying.  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 5: 23</span> and beseecheth him much, 
            saying, My little daughter is at the point of death:  
            is even now dead (<span class="comm">he left her dying, 

                and so stated his fears 
                in the very strongest way</span>): but   I pray thee, that thou come and lay thy 
            hands on {hand upon} her,  
            that she may be made whole, and live.  and she shall 
            live. 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 9: 19</span> And Jesus arose (<span class="comm">From Matthew's table. Jesus did not 
                fast for form's sake, but he was ever ready to leave a feast that he might 
                confer a favor</span>), and followed him, and 
            so did his disciples.  



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 5: 24</span> And he went him; and a great multitude followed him (<span class="comm">The ruler, of highest 
                social rank in the city, found Jesus among the lowliest, and they were 
                naturally curious to see what Jesus would do for this grandee</span>), and 
            they {But as he went the multitudes} thronged him.




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 9: 20</span> And, behold, a woman, who had {having} an issue of blood twelve 
            years,  



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 5: 26</span> and had suffered many things 
            of many physicians, and  who had spentall that she had,  all her living upon 
            physicians,  and was nothing bettered, but rather grew 
            worse,  and could not be healed of any (<span class="comm">Medicine 
                was not a science in that day. Diseases were not cured by medicine, but were 
                exorcised by charms. The physician of Galilee in that age did not differ very 
                widely from the medicine-man of the North American Indians. One in easy 
                circumstances could readily spend all during twelve years of doctoring with 
                such leeches.</span>)  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> having heard the things 
            concerning Jesus (<span class="comm">her faith rested on hearing rather than on sight</span>), 
            came in the crowd behind,  him, and touched the 
            border of his garment:  



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 9: 21</span> for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, {
            garments,} I shall be made whole. (<span class="comm">The nature of her disease made 
                her unclean (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 15: 26</span></span>). Her 
                consciousness of this made her, therefore, timidly approach Jesus from behind.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 5: 29</span> And straightway {immediately}  
            the fountain of her blood was dried up;  the 
            issue of her blood stanched.  and she felt in her body 
            that she was healed of her plague. (<span class="comm">The feeble pulse of sickness gave way 
                to the glow and thrill of health.</span>) 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> And straightway Jesus, perceiving in 
            himself that the power proceeding 
            from him had gone forth, turned him about in the 

            crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?  Who is it that 
            touched me? And when all denied, Peter and they  
            his disciples  that were with him,said unto him,  Master, the multitude 
            press thee and crush thee, 
            Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, 
            Who touched me?  



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 46</span> But Jesus said, Some 
            one did touch me: for I perceived that power had gone forth from me. 




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 5: 32</span> And he looked round about to see her that had 
            done this thing.  



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 47</span> And {<span class="style5">Mark 5: 33</span> But} when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came fearing and trembling (<span class="comm">because being unclean, any rabbi would have rebuked her severely for touching him</span>), knowing what had been done to her, came and fell {falling} down before him and told him all the truth. declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately. (<span class="comm">To have permitted the woman to depart without this exposure would have confirmed her in the mistaken notion that Jesus healed rather by his nature than by his will. Hence he questions her, not that he may obtain information, but rather as a means of imparting it. By his questions he reveals to her that no work of his is wrought without his consciousness, and that it was himself and not his garment which had blessed her.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 9: 22</span> But Jesus turning and seeing her said,  
            unto her,  Daughter, be of good cheer (<span class="comm">Faith 
                gets a sweet welcome</span>); thy faith hath made thee whole.  go in peace.  and be whole of thy 
            plague. (<span class="comm">Be permanently whole: an assurance that relief was not temporal, 
                but final.</span>)   And the woman was made whole from that 
            hour. (<span class="comm">Faith healed her by causing her to so act as to obtain healing. 
                Faith thus saves; not of itself, but by that which it causes us to do. It 
                causes us to so run that we obtain.</span>)



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 5: 35</span> While he 
            yet spake, they come from {there cometh one from} the 
            ruler of the synagogue's house, 
            saying, Thy daughter is dead:  why troublest thou the 
            Teacher any further?  trouble not the Teacher. (<span class="comm">The 
                delay caused by healing this woman must have sorely tried the ruler's patience, 
                and the sad 

                news which followed it must have severely tested his 
                faith; but we hear no word of murmuring or bitterness from him.</span>) 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 50</span> But 
            Jesus hearing it,  not heeding the words spoken 
            (<span class="comm">not succumbing to the situation</span>),  answered him, 
            {saith unto the ruler of the synagogue,} Fear not, 
            only believe.  and she shall be made whole. (<span class="comm">Thus, 
                with words of confidence and cheer, Jesus revived the ruler's failing faith.</span>) 




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 5: 37</span> And he suffered no man to follow with him 
            (<span class="comm">into the house with him</span>), save Peter, and James, and John the 
            brother of James.(<span class="comm">These three were honored above their fellows by special 
                privileges on several occasions, because their natures better fitted them to 
                understand the work of Christ.</span>)   



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 51</span> And when he 
            came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter and

            the ruler's house,  he beholdeth a tumult, and
            many weeping and wailing 
            greatly.  and saw the flute-players, and the crowd

                moment of death, and continued without intermission until the burial, which 
                usually took place on the day of the death. Even to this day Oriental funerals 
                are characterized by noisy uproar and frantic demonstrations of sorrow, made by 
                real and hired mourners. Flute-players, then as now, mingle the plaintive 
                strains of their instruments with the piercing cries of those females who made 
                mourning a profession</span>):

            the child  the damsel is not 
            dead, but sleepeth. (<span class="comm">Jesus used this figurative language with regard to 
                Lazarus, and explained by this he meant death--<span class="style7">John 11: 14</span></span>).</span>) And they laughed him to scorn.  knowing that she was dead. (<span class="comm">His words formed a criticism as 
                to their judgment and experience as to death, and threatened to interrupt them

                dues.</span>)   



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 52</span> But when the crowd was put forth,  he, having put them

                took with him five witnesses, because in the small space of the room few could 
                see distinctly what happened, and those not seeing distinctly might circulate 
                inaccurate reports and confused statements as to what occurred. Besides, Jesus 
                worked his miracles as privately as possible in order to suppress undue 
                excitement.</span>)   and took {taking}
