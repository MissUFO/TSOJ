        <h3>13. THE BOY JESUS VISITS JERUSALEM</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">NAZARETH AND JERUSALEM, A.D. 7 OR 8.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 2: 40-52.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> And the child grew [<span class="comm">This verse contains the 
                history of thirty years. It describes the growth of our Lord as a natural, 
                human growth (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1: 80</span></span>); for, 
                though Jesus was truly divine, he was also perfectly man. To try to distinguish 
                between the divine and human in Jesus, is to waste time upon an impracticable 
                mystery which is too subtle for our dull and finite minds</span>), and waxed 
            strong (<span class="comm">His life expanded like other human lives. He learned as other boys; 
                he obeyed as other children. As he used means and waited patiently for growth, 
                so must each individual Christian, and so must the church. Though the latter is 
                a mystical body, and animated by the Holy Spirit, it must nevertheless make 
                increase of itself before coming to the perfect man -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 4: 16</span></span>), filled with wisdom: and 
                the grace of God was upon him</span> (<span class="comm">These words describe briefly the life of 
                Christ during the preparatory period at Nazareth. It was a quiet life, but its 
                sinless purity made the Baptist feel his own unworthiness compared to it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matt. 3: 14</span></span>), and its sweet 
                reasonableness inspired in Mary, the mother, that confidence which led her to 
                sanction, without reserve, any request or command which Jesus might 
                utter -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 2: 5.</span></span>)</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> And his 
            parents (<span class="comm">Males were required to attend the Passover (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 13: 7</span></span>); but women were not. The great rabbi, Hillel (<span class="comm">born about B.C. 110; died A.D. 10</span>), recommended that they should do so, and the practice was esteemed an act of admirable piety</span>) went every year to Jerusalem (<span class="comm">regular attendance upon worship is likewise enjoined upon us -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 10: 25</span></span>) to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover (<span class="comm">The Passover, one of the three 
                    great Jewish feasts, commemorated the mercy of God in causing his angel to 
                    "pass over" the houses in Israel on the night that he slew all the 
                    firstborn of Egypt. It took place at the full moon which occurred next after 
                    the vernal equinox. At it the firstfruits of the harvest were offered (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 23: 10-15</span></span>). The 
                    second feast, Pentecost, occurred fifty days later, and commemorated the giving 
                    of the law. At it the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, in the form of bread (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 23: 17</span></span>), were offered. The 
                    third feast, or Tabernacles, occurred near the end of September, or beginning 
                    of October, and commemorated the days when Israel dwelt in tents in the 
                    wilderness. It was observed as a thanksgiving for the blessings of the year. 
                    Every adult male Jews dwelling in Jud&aelig;a was required to attend these 
                    three feasts. Josephus tells us that the members assembled at them in Jerusalem 
                    often exceeded two millions.</span>)</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span>  And when he was twelve years old (<span class="comm">The 
                incident which Luke here reports is the only one given in the period between 
                the return from Egypt and Jesus' thirtieth year. It shows that Jesus did not 
                attend the school of the rabbis in Jerusalem(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 
                        6: 2; John 6: 42; 7: 15</span></span>). But we learn that he could write 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 8: 6</span></span>), and there is little 
                doubt but that he spoke both Hebrew and Greek</span>), they went up (<span class="comm">the 
                altitude of Jerusalem is higher than that of Nazareth, and the distance between 
                the two places is about seventy miles</span>) after the custom of the feast 
            (<span class="comm">the custom was that the feast was celebrated annually in Jerusalem</span>);</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span> and when they had fulfilled the days (<span class="comm">eight days in all; one day for 
                killing the passover, and seven for observing the feast of unleavened bread 
                which followed it -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 12: 15; Leviticus 23: 
                        5, 6</span></span>), as they were returning, the boy Jesus (<span class="comm">Luke 
                    narrates something about every stage of Christ's life. He speaks of him as a 
                    babe (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 2: 16</span></span>),as a little child (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 2: 40</span></span>), here as a boy, and afterwards 
                    as a man</span>) tarried behind in Jerusalem (<span class="comm">to take advantage of the 
                    opportunity to hear the great teachers in the schools</span>); 
                and his parents knew it not [<span class="comm">As vast crowds attended the Passover, it was 
                    easy to lose sight of a boy amid the festal throng. Indeed, the incident is 
                    often repeated even to this day during the feast seasons at Jerusalem</span>);</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span>  but supposing him to be in the company (<span class="comm">We see here the confidence of 
                the parents, and the independence of the child. The sinlessness of Jesus was 
                not due to any exceptional care on the part of his parents. Jews going to and 
                from their festivals traveled in caravans for pleasure and safety. In the 
                daytime the young folks mingled freely among the travelers, and sought out 
                whatever companionship they wished. But in the evening, when the camp was 
                formed, and the tents were pitched, the members of each family came together</span>)
            , they went a day's journey (<span class="comm">They probably returned by the way of 
                Jericho to avoid passing through Samaria, because of the hatred existing 
                between Jews and Samaritans. In more moderns times the first day's journey is a 
                short one, and it was probably so then. It was made so in order that the 
                travelers might return to the city whence they had departed, should they 
                discover that they had forgotten anything -- should they find that they had 
                forgotten a sack of meal, a blanket, or a child</span>); and they sought for 
            him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance [<span class="comm">those with whom he was most 
                likely to have traveled during the day</span>):</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> and when they found him 
            not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him. (<span class="comm">Parents who have 
                temporarily suffered the loss of their children can easily imagine their 
                feelings. Christ, though a divine gift to them, was lost. So may we also lose 
                him, though he be God's gift to us.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span>  And it came to pass, after three 
            days (<span class="comm">Each part of a day was reckoned as a day when at the beginning and 
                ending of a series. The parents missed Jesus on the evening of the first day, 
                returned to Jerusalem and sought for him on the second day, and probably found 
                him on the morning of the third day. The disciples of Jesus also lost him in 
                the grave for part of one day, and all of the next, and found him resurrected 
                on the morning of the third day --</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 24: 
                    21</span></span>) they found him in the temple (<span class="comm">Probably 
                in one of the many chambers which tradition says were built against the walls 
                of the temple and its enclosures, and opened upon the temple courts. The sacred 
                secret which they knew concerning the child should have sent them at once to 
                the temple to seek for him</span>); sitting (<span class="comm">Jewish scholars sat upon 
                the ground at the feet of their teachers</span>) in the midst (<span class="comm">the teachers sat 
                on semi-circular benches and thus partially surrounded by their scholars</span>) of 
            the teachers (<span class="comm">these teachers had schools in which they taught for the fees 
                of their pupils, and are not to be confounded with the scribes, who were mere 
                copyists</span>), both hearing them, and asking them questions (<span class="comm">He was 
                not teaching: the God of order does not expect childhood to teach. He was among 
                them as a modest scholar, and not as a forward child. The rabbinical method of 
                instruction was to state cases, or problems, bearing upon the interpretation or 
                application of the law, which cases or problems were to be solved by the 
                pupils. For typical problems (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 22: 15-46</span></span>);</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> and all that heard him were astonished at 
            his understanding and answers.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> And when they (<span class="comm">his parents</span>) 
            saw him, they were astonished (<span class="comm">Mary and Joseph stood as much in awe of 
                these renowned national teachers as peasants do of kings, and were therefore 
                astonished that their youthful son presumed to speak to them</span>); and 
            his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? (<span class="comm">Her 
                language implies that Jesus had been fully instructed as to the time when his 
                parents and their caravan would depart for Galilee, and that he was expected to 
                depart with them. Obedience to his higher duties constrained him to appear 
                disobedient to his parents</span>) behold, thy father (<span class="comm">As legal father of 
                Jesus, this expression would necessarily have to be used when speaking of 
                Joseph. But Jesus does not accept Joseph as his father, as we see by his 
                answer</span>) and I sought thee sorrowing. (<span class="comm">Because they thought him lost.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> And he said unto them (<span class="comm">What follows are the first recorded words of 
                Jesus; he here speaks of the same being -- the Father -- to whom he 
                commended his spirit in his last words upon the cross (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 46</span></span>). His last recorded words on earth are found at (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 1: 7, 8</span></span>);  his last 
                recorded words in heaven are found in (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 22: 10-20</span></span>), but these last words are spoken through the 
                medium of an angel</span>), How is it that ye sought me? (<span class="comm">Mary, knowing 
                all that had been divinely revealed to her concerning Jesus, should have 
                expected to find him in the temple</span>) knew ye not that I must (<span class="comm">In this 
                oft-repeated phrase, "I must," Jesus sets forth that devotion (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 4: 34</span></span>) to the will of the Father 
                by which his whole life was directed</span>) be in my Father's (<span class="comm">Literally 
                "the Father of me." Jesus invariably used the article in speaking 
                of himself, and said "the Father of me," and invariably omitted the 
                article, and said, "Father of you," when speaking of his disciples. 
                His relationship to the Father differed from ours, and God, not Joseph, was his 
                father</span>] house? (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 2: 16, 17; 8: 
                    35</span></span>).</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span>  And they understood not (<span class="comm">It may seem strange that 
                Mary, knowing all that she did concerning the birth of Jesus, etc., did not 
                grasp the meaning of his words, but we are all slow to grasp great truths; and 
                failure to be understood was therefore a matter of daily occurrence with Jesus. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 9: 45; 18: 34; Mark 9: 32; John 10: 
                        6.</span></span>) Christ spoke plainly, but human ears were slow to comprehend his 
                wonderful sayings. We need to be watchful lest our ears be censured for a like 
                slowness</span>) the saying which he spake unto them.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span> And he went 
            down with them (<span class="comm">Jerusalem was among the mountains, Nazareth among the 
                hills</span>), and came to Nazareth (<span class="comm">A beautiful and healthful town, but 
                so lacking in piety and learning as to form the "dry ground" out of 
                which it was prophetically predicted that the glorious and fruitful life of 
                Jesus would spring. Here Christ rose above all times and schools and revealed 
                to man that "life more abundant" than all kings, lawgivers or sages 
                ever discovered. His character, like the New Jerusalem, descended from God out 
                of heaven, and no education obtained in Nazareth will explain it. The struggle 
                of self-made men with their early environment is noticeable to the last, but it 
                is not so with him. The discourses of Jesus are the outpourings of divine 
                knowledge, and not the result of study or self-culture</span>); and he was 
            subject (<span class="comm">Our example in all things, he here set before us that 
                pattern of obedience which children should observe toward their parents. In 
                these years Jesus learned the trade of his supposed father (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 6: 3</span></span>). Christ was a laborer, and thereby 
                sanctified labor, and showed that dignity and glory belong to inward and not to 
                outward conditions</span>) unto them (<span class="comm">His parents, Joseph and Mary. We find no 
                mention of Joseph after this, and the probability is that he soon died</span>): 
            and his mother kept all these 
            sayings in her heart. (<span class="comm">She had many treasured sayings of angels, shepherds, 
                wise men, and prophets. She now began to add to these the sayings of Christ 
                himself.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span> And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God 
            and men. (<span class="comm">He did not literally grow in favor with God. This is a 
                phenomenal expression. The favor of God and man kept company for quite awhile; 
                but the favor of God abode with Jesus when man's good will was utterly 
                withdrawn. Men admire holiness until it becomes aggressive, and then they feel 
                an antagonism against it as great, or intense, as their previous admiration.</span>)
