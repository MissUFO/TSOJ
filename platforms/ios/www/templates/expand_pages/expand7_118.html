        <h3>118. THE FIG-TREE WITHERED.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">ROAD FROM BETHANY TO JERUSALEM, <br>TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 21: 20Ð22;  MARK 11: 19Ð25;  LUKE 21: 37, 38.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 21: 37</span>   And every day he was teaching in the 
            temple (<span class="comm">he was there Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but he seems to have spent 
                Wednesday and Thursday in Bethany</span>); and every night {evening} he went forth out out of the city.  
            and lodged in the mount that is called Olivet. (<span class="comm">As Bethany was on the 
                Mount of Olives, this statement leaves us free to suppose that he spent his 
                nights there, but it is not likely that he retired to any one house or place 
                continuously, for had he done so the rulers could easily have ascertained his 
                whereabouts and arrested him.</span>) 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span>   And all the people came early in the 
            morning to him in the temple, to hear him. (<span class="comm">The enthusiasm of the triumphal 
                entry did not die out in a day: Jesus was still the center of observation.</span>)

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 20</span> And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. (<span class="comm">It was completely withered--dead root and branch. We have observed before, p. 578, that one coming into Jerusalem from Bethany is apt to come down the steep side of Olivet, and that one returning to Bethany is apt to take the easier grade, though longer way, around the south end of the mountain. This fig-tree was apparently on this short road, and was sentenced Monday morning. The disciples, returning by the other or longer road to Bethany or its vicinity, did not see the tree Monday evening, but they saw it Tuesday morning, when they again came back by the short road. From these facts argue a method of coming and going, from which it may be fairly inferred that Jesus, on the day of his triumphal entry, approached Jerusalem by the short road, though Stanley, Edersheim, and many others, think he came in over the long road.</span>)



        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 20</span>    When the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How 
            did the fig tree immediately wither away? (<span class="comm">Jesus had simply condemned it to 
                fruitlessness, but his condemnation involved it in an evil which it justly 
                deserved. The judgment of God reveals; and that which is dead in fact is made 
                dead in appearance also.</span>)  

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 21</span>   And Peter calling to 
            remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst 
            (<span class="comm">devotedst to death</span>) is withered away. (<span class="comm">Peter is surprised both at the 
                suddenness and at the fullness of the judgment. Since the miracles of Jesus, 
                heretofore, had been only those of mercy, Peter boldly invited the Lord to 
                discuss this miracle, hoping for more light on its meaning.</span>) </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span>  And Jesus 
            answering saith {answered and said} unto them,
            Have faith in God. 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span>   Verily I say unto you,
            If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do 
            what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye {whosoever} shall say unto this mountain (<span class="comm">Olivet</span>), Be thou taken 
            up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe 
            that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.  
            it shall be done. 


        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 22</span>   And </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 24</span>   
            Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, {ye shall ask in prayer,}  believe 
            that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. {believing, ye shall receive.} (<span class="comm">Jesus here lays down the broad general rule 
                in the application of which we must be guided by other Scriptures. The rule is, 
                indeed, liberal and gracious, and the limitations are just and reasonable. We 
                must not expect to obtain that which it is unlawful for us to desire (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 4: 2, 3</span></span>), or which it is unwise for us to 
                seek (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Corinthians 12: 7Ð9</span></span>), nor 
                must we selfishly run counter to the will of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 22: 42; 1 John 5: 14, 15</span></span>), nor must we expect that God shall 
                perform a miracle for us, for miracles have ceasedÑin short, we 

                must pray to God in full remembrance of the relationship between us, 
                we must consider that he is the Ruler and we his subjects, and are not to think 
                for one moment that by faith we can alter this eternal, unchangeable relation. 
                The disciples whom Jesus addressed were very soon to enter upon a task which 
                would seem to them as difficult as the removal of mountains. The license and 
                immorality of paganism, and the bigotry and prejudice of Judaism, would seem 
                insurmountable obstacles in their pathway to success. They needed to be assured 
                that the power of faith was superior to all these adverse forces, and that the 
                judgments of God could accomplish in a moment changes which apparently could 
                not be wrought out in the tedious course of years. As we to-day look back upon 
                this promise of Christ we can see that the mountains then standing have, 
                indeed, been removed; and that which seemed vigorous and flourishing has been 
                blasted in a day.</span>)   


        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> And whensoever ye stand (<span class="comm">a customary attitude--<span class="style7">Luke 18: 13</span></span>) praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your 
            Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. (<span class="comm">Forgiveness 
                has already been enjoined (<span class="comm">see pp. 253, 254</span>). Here our Lord emphasizes the need 
                of forgiveness because he had just performed a miracle of judgment, and he 
                wished his disciples to understand that they must not exercise their miraculous 
                gifts with a vengeful, unforgiving spirit. They must suffer evil and not 
                retaliate with miracles of judgment.</span>)
