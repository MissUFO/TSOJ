        <h3>125. THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 24: 29-51;  MARK 13: 24-37; LUKE 21: 25-36.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> But in those days,  
            immediately after the {that}  
            tribulation of those days. (<span class="comm">Since the coming of Christ did not follow close 
                upon the destruction of Jerusalem, the word "immediately" used by 
                Matthew is somewhat puzzling. There are, however, three ways in which it may be 
                explained: 1. That Jesus reckons the time after his own divine, and not after 
                our human, fashion. Viewing the word in this light, the passage at <span class="style7">2 Peter 3: 4-9</span> may almost be regarded 
                as an inspired comment with reference to this passage. 2. The terrible judgment 
                upon Jerusalem and the corresponding terror of the judgment day have between 
                them no intervening season of judgment in any way worthy to be compared to 
                either of them. The two periods, therefore, stand with regard to each other in 
                immediate connection. 3. The tribulation which came upon the Jewish people 
                merely began with the destruction of Jerusalem, other woes followed at 
                once, and, coming down through all the centuries of wandering and 
                dispersion, they were yet unfulfilled and incomplete. See <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 28: 58-68</span></span>) the sun shall be darkened, 
            and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall 
            {shall be falling} from heaven,  
            and the powers of 

            {that are 
            in} the heavens shall be shaken. (<span class="comm">The language is that of the ancient 
                prophets. See <span class="style7">Amos 8: 9; Joel 2: 30, 31; Ezekiel 32: 7, 8</span>. Compare also <span class="style7">Revelation 6: 12-14</span>. Some regard the language as metaphorical, indicating 
                the eclipse of nations and the downfall of rulers, but there are many similar 
                passages of Scripture which constrain us to regard the language here as literal 
                rather than figurative. See <span class="style7">2 Peter 3: 10; Hebrews 1: 12; Revelation 20: 11</span>.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> And there shall 
            be signs in sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in 
            perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows (<span class="comm">We can conceive of 
                nothing which would produce greater mental distress or perplexity than changes 
                in the position or condition of the heavenly bodies. Such changes will be 
                followed by corresponding commotions on our planet, as, for instance, great 
                tidal waves and vast agitation in the ocean</span>); </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> men fainting for 
            fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the 
            powers of the heavens shall be shaken.  </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven (<span class="comm">The coming 
                and the sign are the same thing. The word "sign" is used in 
                connection with the coming of Christ to indicate that the nature of the coming 
                (<span class="comm">that is, the manner of its manifestations</span>) will be fully commensurate with the 
                importance of the event. His first coming in the manger was not so</span>): 
            and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn (<span class="comm">The coming will occasion 
                universal mourning in the unprepared, and apparently the majority of people 
                will be in that condition. The term "all" is not, however, to be 
                construed as including all individuals--<span class="style7">1 Thessalonians 4: 15-17</span></span>), </p> 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> And 
            then shall they see the Son of man coming in {on the} 
            clouds {in a cloud}  of 
            heaven  with great power  and 
            great glory.  </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span>  And then 
            shall he send forth the {his} angels with a great 
            sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four 
            winds, from one of heaven to the other.  from the 
            uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. (<span class="comm">To the Jews 
                the trumpet would naturally be 

                associated with the assembling of 
                the people, for silver trumpets were used to call Israel together (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 10: 1-4; Exodus 19: 13, 16, 19; Psalm 81: 3-5</span></span>). We are not told why angels are used on this occasion, 
                but they appear to be employed in all the great operations of Providence 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 13: 41</span></span>). The phrases 
                "four winds," etc., indicate that the angelic search shall extend 
                over the entire globe. The language is that which was then used when one 
                desired to indicate the whole earth. It is based upon the idea which then 
                prevailed that the earth is flat, and that it extends outward in one vast plain 
                until it meets and is circumscribed by the overarching heavens.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift 
            up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh. (<span class="comm">The preliminary 
                death-throes of this present physical universe, which will strike terror to the 
                souls of those who have limited themselves to material hopes, will be to the 
                Christian a reassuring sign, since he looks for a new heaven and a new earth.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> And he spake to them a parable:</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is 
            now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is 
            nigh;  Behold the fig tree, and all the trees:</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> when they now shoot forth, ye see it and know of your own selves that 
            the summer is now nigh. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> Even so ye 
            also, when ye see  all  these 
            things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh.know ye that he is nigh, even
            at the doors. (<span class="comm">As the change of the season in the natural 
                world has its preliminary signs, so the change of conditions in the spiritual 
                realm has its premonitory symptoms. When men see the symptoms which Jesus has 
                described, they will recognize that changes are coming as to the nature of 
                which they can only guess. But the Christian is informed that these changes 
                indicate the coming of the Son of God--a change from a worse to a better 
                season.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
            until all things be accomplished. (<span class="comm">Commentators 
                differ widely as to the import of these words. Godet is so perplexed by them 
                that he thinks 

                they refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, and 
                have been misplaced by the Evangelist. Cook straddles the difficulty by giving 
                a dual significance to all that our Lord has said concerning his coming, so 
                that our Lord in one narrative speaks figuratively of a coming in the 
                power of his kingdom before, during, and right after the destruction of 
                Jerusalem, and literally of his final coming at the end of the world. 
                But this perplexing expression under this theory refers exclusively to the 
                figurative and not to the literal sense of the passage. The simplest solution 
                of the matter is to take the word "generation" to mean the Jewish 
                family or race--and the word does mean race or family--<span class="style7">Luke 16: 8</span>. Thus interpreted, the passage becomes 
                a prophecy that the Jewish people shall be preserved as such until the coming 
                of Christ. The marvelous and almost miraculous preservation of the racial 
                individuality of the Jews, though dispersed among all nations, might well 
                become the subject of prophecy, especially when Jesus had just spoken of an 
                event which threatened their very extermination.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> Heaven and earth shall 
            pass away: but my words shall not pass away. (<span class="comm">The disciples had regarded 
                the temple as so permanent that they found it hard to conceive that Christ's 
                words could be fulfilled with regard to it; but he assures them that his 
                predictions and prophecies are the stable and imperishable things. That even 
                the more permanent structure of the heavens is not so abiding as his 
                utterances.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> But of that day and {or that} hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in {of} heaven, neither the Son,  but the 
            Father.  only. (<span class="comm">These words indicate the profound 
                secrecy in which God has concealed the hour of judgment. It is concealed from 
                all people, that each generation may live in expectation of its fulfillment, 
                and we are to watch for the signs, though we may not fully know the times. They 
                also indicate that either by reason of his assumption of our human nature, or 
                by a voluntary act on his part, the knowledge of Jesus became in some respects 
                circumscribed. They also suggest that it is not only idle, but also 
                presumptuous, for men to strive to find out by mathematical calculation and 
                expositions of 

                prophecy that which the Son of God did not know.</span>) <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And as were the days of 
            Noah, so shall be the coming of the Son of man. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> For as in those 
            days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and 
            giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be 
            the coming of the Son of man. (<span class="comm">See p. 532.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> Then shall two man be in 
            the field; one is taken, and one is left: </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, 
            and one is left. (<span class="comm">See p. 533.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> Watch therefore: for ye know not on 
            what day your Lord cometh. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span> But know this, that if the master of 
            the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, 
            and would not have suffered his house to be broken through. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> 
            Therefore be ye also ready; for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man 
            cometh. (<span class="comm">See p. 322.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> But take heed to 
            yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and 
            drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly as a 
            snare: </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> for so 
            shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth. (<span class="comm">The 
                image of a snare is that of a net which suddenly encloses a covey of birds as 
                they feed in seeming safety. The warnings here given are applicable to our 
                appearing before Christ whether he comes to meet us, or we depart from this 
                life to meet him. The result is the same, whether he comes and finds us 
                unprepared or whether we go hence without preparation.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath 
            set over his household, to give them their food in due season? </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> 
            Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he 
            hath. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord 
            tarrieth; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and 
            shall eat and drink with the drunken; </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span> the lord of that 
            servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he 
            knoweth not, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span> and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion 
            with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. 
            (<span class="comm">See p. 323.</span>)</p>   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> But watch ye at every season, 
            making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall 
            come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. (<span class="comm">The revealed presence of 
                God is represented as such an overpowering event that sinners are crushed to 
                the earth by it. Only the godly are able to stand in his 
                presence--<span class="style7">Psalm 1: 5; Malachi 3: 2</span>.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> It is 
            as when a man, sojourning in 
            another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to 
            each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch. (<span class="comm">Under the figure of 
                the householder and the thief, Jesus appealed to the sense of danger. Under the 
                figure of the servant he appealed to the sense of duty, and under this figure 
                of the porter he appealed to the sense of loyalty. The porter's desire to honor 
                his lord was to make him so vigilant that he would open the door at once upon 
                his lord's appearing.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of 
            the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the 
            morning (<span class="comm">The night was then divided into four watches. See p. 322. Jesus 
                may here refer either to the duration of the world or to the life of the 
                individual. He divides either period into four sections, in accordance with the 
                night watches which were so fully associated with watchfulness</span>); </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span>  
            lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And what I say unto 
            you I say unto all, Watch. (<span class="comm">This warning message was not for the apostles 
                alone, but for all disciples.</span>)</p>
