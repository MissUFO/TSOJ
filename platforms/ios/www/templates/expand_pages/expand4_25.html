                and tetrarch, or governor, of Galilee</span>), being reproved by him 
            (<span class="comm">that is, by John the Baptist</span>) for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all 
            the evil things which Herod had done (<span class="comm">A full account of the sin of Herod <span class="style7">Matthew 14: 1-12</span> and 
                <span class="style7">Mark 6: 14-29</span>. John had spoken the truth

                weighty reasons which justified his condemnation</span>), that he shut up 
            John in prison. (<span class="comm">In the fortress at Mach&aelig;rus, east of the Dead Sea, 
                as we learn from Josephus. The duration of the ministry of John the Baptist is 
                variously estimated at from fourteen to eighteen months.</span>)   </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> Now after John was delivered up (<span class="comm">either delivered up by the people to Herod (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 17: 12</span></span>), or delivered up by Herod himself to the warden of the castle of Mach&aelig;rus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 12: 58</span></span>), or by Providence to Herod himself--<span class="style7">Acts 2: 23</span></span>), 
            when he (<span class="comm">Jesus</span>) heard (<span class="comm">he was in Jud&aelig;a 
                when he heard it</span>) that John was delivered up (<span class="comm">and</span>), 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard 
            that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John (<span class="comm">We saw at <span class="style7">John 3: 26</span> how the Baptist heard 
                about the number of Jesus' baptisms, being informed by his jealous friends. 
                Like jealous friends, no doubt, informed the Pharisees. Jesus may have known of 
                this information being given by reason of his supernatural powers, but it is 
                more likely that he heard of it in a natural way</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> (<span class="comm">although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples</span>) (<span class="comm">Jesus, as divine Lawgiver, instituted baptism, and his disciples administered it. We nowhere hear of the disciples of John administering baptism. In fact, the Baptist, like the disciples of Jesus, baptized under a divine commission, and could not delegate the power to others. It was the office of Jesus to commission others to this work, not to perform it himself. Had he done so, those baptized by him might have foolishly claimed for themselves some peculiar honor by reason thereof (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 1: 14, 15</span></span>). Jesus was the spiritual baptizer, in which 
                baptism the efficacy lies in the administrant; but water baptism, the efficacy 
                of which lies rather in the spirit of the one baptized than in the virtues of 
                the administrant, Jesus left to his disciples</span>),</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> he left Jud&aelig;a, and departed again (<span class="comm">withdrewcame</span>) into Galilee. (<span class="comm">We have in these verses two reasons assigned for the withdrawal of Jesus into Galilee, namely: 1. The imprisonment of John the Baptist 2. Knowledge of the Pharisees that Jesus was baptizing more disciples than John. The first gives us the reason why he went to Galilee, the second the reason why he left Jud&aelig;a. Jesus did not go into Galilee through fear of Herod, for Herod was tetrarch of Galilee. The truth is, the absence of John called for the presence of Jesus. The northern part of Palestine was the most fruitful soil for the gospel. During the last six or eight months of John's ministry we find him in this northern field, preparing it for Christ's kingdom. While we can not say definitely that John was in Galilee (<span class="comm">Bethabara and &AElig;non being the only two geographical names given</span>), yet he certainly drew his audiences largely from the towns and cities of Galilee. While John occupied the northern, Jesus worked in the southern district of Palestine; but when John was removed, then Jesus turned northward, that he might sow the seed of the kingdom in its most fruitful soil. But if there was a reason why he should go to Galilee, there was an equal reason why he should depart from Jud&aelig;a. His popularity, manifesting itself in the number of his baptisms, was exciting that envy and opposition which caused the rulers of Jud&aelig;a eventually to take the life of Jesus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 27: 18</span></span>). The Pharisees loved to make proselytes themselves (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 23: 15</span></span>). They no doubt envied John's popularity, and much more, therefore, would they be disposed to envy Christ. The influence of the Pharisees was far greater in Jud&aelig;a than in Galilee, and the Sanhedrin would readily have arrested Jesus had he remained in Jud&aelig;a (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 7: 1; 10: 39</span></span>), and arrest at this time would have marred the work of Jesus. Therefore, since it is neither sinful nor unbecoming to avoid persecution, Jesus retired to Galilee, when he remained until his second passover. By birth a prophet of Jud&aelig;a, he became, in public estimation, by this retirement, a prophet of Galilee. Though Jesus first taught in Jud&aelig;a, the ministry in Galilee so far eclipsed the work in Jud&aelig;a that it was spoken of as the place of beginning (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 5; Acts 10: 37</span></span>), and prophetically designated as the scene of the divine manifestation--<span class="style7">Matthew 4: 14</span>.</span>) </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> And he must needs pass through Samaria. (<span class="comm">The province which took its name from the city of Samaria, and which lay between Jud&aelig;a and Galilee. Owing to the hatred which existed between Jews and Samaritans, many of the Jews went from Jerusalem to Galilee by turning eastward, crossing the Jordan, and passing northward through Per&aelig;a. This journey required about seven days, while the more direct route, through Samaria, only took three days. Galil&aelig;ans often passed through Samaria on their way to and from the Jerusalem feast (<span class="comm">Josephus' Antiquities 20: 6, 1</span>). The arrest of John would scatter his flock of disciples (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 14: 27</span></span>), and Jesus, as chief shepherd (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Peter 5: 1-4</span></span>), hastened to 
                Galilee, to gather together those which might else go astray and be lost.</span>)
