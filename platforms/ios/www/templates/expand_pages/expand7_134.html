        <h3>134. GOING TO GETHSEMANE.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">A GARDEN BETWEEN THE BROOK KIDRON AND THE MOUNT OF OLIVES.<br>LATE THURSDAY NIGHT.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 26: 30, 36-46;  MARK 14: 26, 32-42;  LUKE 22: 39-46;  JOHN 18: 1.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 1</span> When Jesus had spoken these words (<span class="comm">the words 
                contained in <span class="style7">John 14:-16</span>:</span>),

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mattew 26: 30</span> And when they had sung a hymn (<span class="comm">the 
                shadow of the cross did not quench the spirit of praise in Christ</span>), 
            they went out

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 39</span> And he came out, and
            he went forth with his disciples  
            as his custom was,  over the brook Kidron,into {unto} the mount of Olives.
            where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his 
            disciples. {and the disciples also followed him.}

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 36</span> Then cometh Jesus with them

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 32</span> And they come unto a place which was named {called} Gethsemane (<span class="comm">The name Gethsemane means a place 
                of oil-presses, and hence it accords well with the name of the mountain at 
                whose base it was situated. But the place was now a garden. It was about half a 
                mile from the city, and from what Luke says here and elsewhere (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 21: 37</span></span>), it seems that Jesus often resorted 
                to it while in Jerusalem at the festivals. Compare also <span class="style7">John 18: 2</span></span>),

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 40</span> And 
            when he was at the place, he said {saith} unto his 
            disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray.  Pray that ye 
            enter not into temptation. (<span class="comm">As the hour of trial and temptation came upon 
                Jesus he fortified himself against it by prayer. And he bade his disciples do 
                likewise, for his arrest would involve them also in temptations which he 

                foresaw that they would not be able to withstand.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 37</span> And he took {taketh} with him 
            Peter  and the two sons of Zebedee,  
            James and John, and began to be greatly amazed,  
            sorrowful and sore troubled. (<span class="comm">While seeking heavenly aid in this hour of 
                extremity, our Lord also manifested his desire for human sympathy. All the 
                eleven apostles were with him in the garden, and the three most capable of 
                sympathizing with him were stationed nearer to him than the rest.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 41</span> And he was parted from them about a stone's cast (<span class="comm">one 
                hundred fifty to two hundred feet</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 38</span> Then {And <span class="style5">Mark 14: 34</span>} saith he unto them, My soul 
            is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death:  abide ye 
            here, and watch.  with me. (<span class="comm">The sequel shows that 
                the phrase "even unto death" was no figure of rhetoric. The nervous 
                prostration of Jesus was such as to endanger his life, and the watching of the 
                apostles may have been doubly needful. Not only did he require their sympathy, 
                but he may also have looked to them to render him assistance in the case of a 
                physical collapse.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> And he went forward a little,  
            and he kneeled down  and fell on the face,
            and fell on his face, and prayed,  
            that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. (<span class="comm">This posture 
                was expressive of the most intense supplication.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 36</span> And he said, {
            saying,}  Abba,  
            My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me:all things are possible unto thee;  if 
            thou be willing, remove this cup from me:  howbeit
            nevertheless, not as {what} I 
            will,  but as {what} thou 
            wilt.  not my will, but thine, be done. (<span class="comm">Much of 
                mystery is found in all life, so it is small wonder if the dual nature of Jesus 
                presents insoluble problems. It perplexes many to find that the divine in Jesus 
                did not sustain him better during his trial in the garden. But we must remember 
                that it was appointed unto Jesus to die, and that the divine in him was not to 
                interfere with this appointment, or the approaches to it. For want, therefore, 
                of a better expression, we may say that from the time Jesus entered the garden 
                until he expired on the cross, the human in him was in the 

                ascendant; and "being found in fashion as a man," he endured these 
                trials is if wholly human. His prayer, therefore, is the cry of his humanity 
                for deliverance. The words "if it is possible" with which it opens 
                breathe the same spirit of submissive obedience which is found in the closing 
                words. Reminding the Father of the limitless range of his power, he petitions 
                him to change his counsel as to the crucifixion of the Son, if his gracious 
                purposes can be in any other way carried out. Jesus uses the words 
                "cup" and "hour" interchangeably. They are both words 
                of broad compass, intended to include all that he would undergo from that time 
                until his resurrection. They embrace all his mental, moral, physical, and 
                spiritual suffering which we can discover, together with an infinite volume of 
                a propitiatory and vicarious nature which lies beyond the reach of our 
                understanding. The submission of Jesus was no new fruitage of his character; 
                the prayer of the garden had been the inner purpose of his entire 
                life--<span class="style7">John 5: 30 and 6: 38</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 22: 43</span> And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became 
            as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. (<span class="comm">Commentators 
                give instances of bloody sweat under abnormal pathological conditions.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> And when he rose up from his prayer, he came {cometh} 
            unto the disciples, and findeth {found} them sleeping 
            for sorrow,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, 
            that ye enter not into temptation. (<span class="comm">The admonition which had at first been 
                addressed to all the eleven is now spoken to the chosen three</span>)   
            and saith unto Peter,  Simon, sleepest thou? 
            couldest thou not watch one hour?  What, could ye not 
            watch with me one hour?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 41</span> Watch and pray, that ye 
            enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is 
            weak. (<span class="comm">Peter, having boasted of his loyalty, has his weakness pointed out 
                and is further warned to be on his guard, since the weakness of his nature will 
                not stand the coming strain. The slumber of the disciples was not through 
                indifference; but was 

                caused by the prostration of grief. When we 
                remember the excitement which they had endured that night, the tender words 
                spoken by Jesus, the sadness of which was intensified by the atmosphere of 
                mystery which pervaded them, the beautiful and touching prayer, and lastly this 
                agony in the garden, it is not to be wondered at that the apostles, spurred by 
                no sense of danger, should succumb to the long-borne tension and fall asleep. 
                Had they comprehended how much the Lord needed their wakeful sympathy as 
                he came again and again seeking for it, they would probably have kept awake.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 39</span> And again  a second 
            time he went away, and prayed,  saying the same 
            words.  saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, 
            except I drink it, thy will be done. (<span class="comm">Jesus here speaks of draining the 
                cup. The "cup" was a common Hebrew figure used to denote one's 
                divinely appointed lot or fortune--<span class="style7">Psalm 23: 5; 75: 8; Isaiah 52: 17; Ezekiel 23: 31-33</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 26: 43</span> And he 
            came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were  
            very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him. (<span class="comm">They were ashamed of 
                the stupor which had come upon them and knew not what apology to make for it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> And he left them again, and went away, and 
            prayed a third time, saying again the same words.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> Then {And <span class="style5">Mark 14: 41</span>} cometh he 
            to the disciples,  the third time, and saith unto them, 
            Sleep on now, and that your rest: it is enough;  
            behold, the hour is at hand, {the hour is come;}
            and  behold, the Son of man is 
            betrayed into the hands of sinners.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 14: 42</span> Arise, let us 
            be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand. (<span class="comm">Our Lord's words are 
                paradoxical. In our judgment the saying is best understood by regarding the 
                first part of it as spoken from the Lord's viewpoint, while the latter part is 
                spoken from the disciple's viewpoint. It is as if he said, "So far as I 
                am concerned, you may sleep on and take your rest, for the time to be of 
                comfort or assistance to me has wholly passed. But so far as you yourselves are 
                concerned, you must arise and be going, because Judas with his band of temple 
                police is upon us."</span>)
