        <h3>37. JESUS HEALS ON THE SABBATH.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT FEAST-TIME AT JERUSALEM, PROBABLY THE PASSOVER.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 5: 1-47.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> After these things there was a feast of the Jews; 
            and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. (<span class="comm">Though every feast in the Jewish calendar 
                has found some one to advocate its claim to be this unnamed feast, yet the vast 
                majority of commentators choose either the feast of Purim, which came in March, 
                or the Passover, which came in April. Older commentators pretty unanimously 
                regarded it as the Passover, while the later school favor the feast of Purim. <span class="style7">John 4: 35</span> locates Jesus in Samaria in 
                December, and <span class="style7">John 6: 4</span> finds him on 
                the shores of Galilee just before a Passover. If, then, this was the feast of 
                Purim, the Passover of<span class="style7"> John 6: 4</span> was 
                the second in Jesus' ministry, and that ministry lasted but two years 
                and a fraction. But if the feast here mentioned was a Passover, then the one at <span class="style7">John 6: 4</span> would be the third 
                Passover, and the ministry of Jesus lasted three years and a fraction. Since, 
                then, the length of Jesus' ministry is largely to be determined by what the 
                feast was, it becomes important for us to fix the feast, if possible. That it 
                was not Purim the following arguments may be urged. 1. Purim was not a 

                Mosaic feast, but one established by human laws; hence Jesus would not 
                be likely to observe it. True, we find him at the feast of Dedication, 
                which was also of human origin, but he did not "go up" to attend 
                it; he appears to have attended because he was already in Jerusalem (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 10: 22</span></span>). 2. Here the pregnant juxtaposition 
                of "feast" and "went up" indicates that Jesus was 
                drawn to Jerusalem by this feast, but Purim was celebrated by the Jews 
                everywhere, and did not require that any one should go to Jerusalem, as did the 
                three great festivals--Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles. 3. It was kept 
                in a boisterous, riotous manner, and was therefore not such a feast as Jesus 
                would honor. 4. It came early in the year, when the weather was too rigorous 
                and inclement for sick people to frequent porticos. 5. It did not include a 
                Sabbath Day. 6. As Purim was just a month before the Passover, Jesus would 
                hardly have returned to Galilee before the Passover (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 6: 4</span></span>) unless he intended to miss the Passover, which he 
                would hardly do for the sake of attending Purim in Jerusalem. Those contending 
                that it was not the Passover, present several arguments, which we note and 
                answer as follows: 1. Since John gives the name of other Passovers, he would 
                have named this also, had it been one. But the conclusion is inferential, and 
                not logical; and the answer is to be twofold: first, perhaps John did give the 
                name by prefixing the article to it, and calling it "the feast," 
                for being the oldest--older than the law and the Sabbath--and most 
                important of all feasts, it was rightly called by pre-eminence "the 
                feast." Since the Sinaitic manuscript gives the article, and calls it 
                "the feast," the manuscript authority for and against this reading 
                is pretty evenly balanced. Second, if John did not name it, there is probably 
                this reason for his silence. Where he names the feast elsewhere it is thought 
                that the incidents narrated take color from, or have some references to, the 
                particular festal occasion which is named; but here there is no such local 
                color, and failure to name the feast prevents mistaken attempts to find such 
                local color. 2. Again it is objected that if this is a different Passover from <span class="style7">John 6: 4</span>, then John skips 

                a year in the life of Jesus. He probably does so skip, and this is not strange 
                when the supplemental nature of his Gospel is considered. In favor of its being 
                the Passover we submit two points: 1. Daniel seems to forecast the ministry of 
                the Messiah as lasting one-half of a week of years (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Daniel 9: 27</span></span>). 2. It fits better in the chronological arrangement, 
                for in the next scene we find the disciples plucking grain, and the Sabbath 
                question is still at full heat. But the harvest season opens with the 
                Passover.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> Now there is (<span class="comm">the present tense is used, for while the city was destroyed, the pool evidently still existed.</span>) in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew (<span class="comm">i. e., in Aramaic, a dialect of the classic Hebrew, in which the Old Testament was written, and the language then in use in Palestine</span>) Bethesda, having five porches (<span class="comm">It had five covered porticos, probably erected for the accommodation of the sick, whence it is called Bethesda, i.e., &quot;house of mercy.&quot; Dr. Barclay thinks that this pool is buried in the rubbish of the Kedron valley. Dr. Robinson suggested that it might be the Fountain of the Virgin, which is found in a cavern under the east side of Ophel, a little north of midway between the southeast corner of the temple wall and the Pool of Siloam. Though this pool's claim has been objected to because of its inaccessibility--for it lies thirty feet below the surface of the valley and forty feet back under the mountain, and is approached by two flights of steps numbering in all twenty-six--yet it has three distinct features which make its claim exceed those of any other known pool in the temple neighborhood: 1. It is fed by an intermittent spring, whose ebbing and flowing at intervals of several hours, would cause the troubled waters called for in <span class="style7">John 5:7</span>. 2. It has 
                a superstition connected with it kindred to that which crept into the text at 
                <span class="style7">John 5: 4</span>, but the Mohammedans have 
                changed the angel into a dragon; when the dragon is awake he swallows or stops 
                the water, but when he sleeps the water flows! 3. The modern Jerusalem Jews 
                believe in the special healing properties of this fountain. "Every 
                day," says Conder, "crowds of both sexes go down 

                to the spring, and, entering the dark archway, descend the steps, and await the 
                fitful troubling of the waters, which rise suddenly and immerse them, fully 
                clothed, nearly up to the neck." But Nehemiah's description of the walls 
                seems to locate the sheep gate near the middle or northern portion of the 
                temple area, and too far north for the Virgin's fountain to be described as 
                near it, unless John's sheep gate differs from that of Nehemiah.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> In these 
            lay a great multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered. (<span class="comm">The 
                rest of <span class="style7">John 5: 3</span> and all of <span class="style7">John 5: 4</span>, as 
                given in the King James version, were probably added as a marginal explanatory 
                gloss early in the second century, and from thence gradually became 
                incorporated in the text. John's failure to mention that the pool was thought 
                to have medicinal qualities tempted transcribers to add a few marginal words in 
                the nature of comments.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And a certain man was there, who had been thirty 
            and eight years in his infirmity. (<span class="comm">It is not said that he had spent all 
                these years beside the pool, nor is it likely that he had. The time is given to 
                mark the inveteracy of the disease, and to show the pathos of his situation. 
                The facts that he had a bed, and that his healing was demonstrated by his 
                walking, argue that his disease was either rheumatism, or some form of 
                paralysis.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> When Jesus saw him lying, and knew (<span class="comm">By divine intuition, 
                just as he also knew the lives of Nathanael and the Samaritan woman at Jacob's 
                well</span>) that he had been now a long time in 
            that case, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole? 
            (<span class="comm">By this question Jesus aroused the man from the apathy of despair, awakening 
                him to hope and effort. Moreover, Jesus only healed as men consented to his 
                healing.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is 
            troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down 
            before me. (<span class="comm">The man's lack of healing was not due to want of interest, but 
                to want of means. The lower flight of ten steps leading to the Virgin's pool is 
                only four and half feet wide, and the pool itself is but twenty-one feet and 
                nine inches by nine feet 

                in breadth at its widest part. A 
                half-dozen selfish men rushing down this narrow passage, and filling the small 
                space in the pool, would easily crowd out one who was friendless and more than 
                usually helpless.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and 
            walk. (<span class="comm">The bed was the light mattress or pallet of the poor elsewhere 
                noted, which could be easily rolled up and carried under the arm.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And 
            straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. (<span class="comm">Christ 
                spoke, the man obeyed, and by the obedience of faith was made whole.</span>) Now it 
            was the sabbath on that day. (<span class="comm">There was apparently nothing urgent in the 
                sick man's condition which made an immediate cure necessary; but Jesus healed 
                because it was the Sabbath, that he might thereby draw such an issue between 
                himself and the Jewish rulers as would afford opportunity for him to present 
                his divine claims to them in the clearest and most forceful manner. He healed 
                on the sabbath, that he might assert divine relations to the Sabbath, and by so 
                doing bring about a disputation which would enable him to develop before them 
                his divine relations to the Father.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> So the Jews (<span class="comm">That is, the Jewish 
                rulers. John frequently uses the term with this restricted meaning (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 19; 7: 13; 9: 22; 18: 12-14</span></span>). The 
                man was officially stopped and questioned</span>) said unto him that was cured, It 
            is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed. (<span class="comm">They 
                would have cited in proof of their assertion<span class="style7"> Exodus 31: 13; Numbers 15: 35; Jeremiah 17: 21-23; Nehemiah 13: 19</span>. Alford 
                and Schaff both assert that the man broke the Mosaic law; but this position is 
                not well taken. Jesus would not have ordered the sabbath to be broken, for he 
                came to fulfill and not to break the law. At no time did he break the sabbath 
                or countenance its violation, as some able thinkers are erroneously led to 
                suppose. In this case a man lying on his bed, away from home, is suddenly 
                healed. Under such circumstances Jewish tradition said that he must 
                either spend the rest of the day watching his bed, or else he must go off and 
                leave it to be stolen. But He who rightfully interpreted the law of 

                his own devising, and who knew that "the sabbath was made for 
                man, and not man for the sabbath," ordered the healed one to carry his 
                bed along home with him. The modern notions that this constituted a breach of 
                the Mosaic sabbath doubtless arose from the nature of the accompanying 
                justification given by Jesus, which fails to assert that the law has not been 
                broken, but seems almost to admit that it has. Nothing, however, can be argued 
                against Jesus on this score. A man may be able to justify an act in a dozen 
                different ways, and may choose to rest content in justifying himself in only 
                one way. Such is the case here. Elsewhere we shall find that Jesus was careful 
                to show that his sabbatic actions were strictly legal; but in this case, that 
                he might bring his divine claims plainly before the rulers, he ignored the 
                question as to the human legality of his act that he might present without 
                confusion its divine legality. Hence he used only one order or method of 
                justification; viz.: an appeal to his divine rights as exhibited in the habits 
                of his Father. It was the divine and not the human in Jesus which wrought this 
                miracle, so Jesus causes the whole controversy to turn on the divine rights, 
                that he may use the occasion for an elaborate discussion of his divine claims 
                and the proofs by which they are sustained.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> But he answered them, He 
            that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. (<span class="comm">The 
                man very naturally shifts the burden of responsibility. If he was violating the 
                sabbath, he had been ordered to do it by one who had alone empowered him to do 
                it. Of himself he would not and could not have done it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> They asked him, 
            Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy 
            bed, and walk? (<span class="comm">By using the word "man" they 
                suggest the contrast between human authority and divine law. They were more 
                concerned about the law than about mercy.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> But he that was healed knew 
            not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the 
            place. (<span class="comm">Jesus, not wishing to unduly excite the multitude by his presence, 
                had passed on.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the 

            temple (<span class="comm">possibly he was there offering sacrifices in thanksgiving for his 
                recovery, in the spirit of<span class="style7"> Psalm 66: 13-14</span>, but it is as likely that he was there merely enjoying the sights 
                and privileges from which he had so long been excluded</span>), and said 
            unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall 
            thee. (<span class="comm">Many human ills are directly traceable to sin, and this one appears 
                to have been so; for death is the wages of sin, and sickness is partial 
                payment. It is a solemn thought that sin can produce worse conditions than even 
                this case, where it found its victim in youth, and left him a withered old man, 
                bed-ridden, helpless, and friendless.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> The man went away, and told the 
            Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole. (<span class="comm">There was evidently no 
                unworthy motive in his action; for, as Chrysostom observes, he did not report 
                it that it was Jesus who made him break the sabbath to condemn Jesus; on the 
                contrary, he said it was Jesus who made him whole, so honoring Christ. Feeling 
                (<span class="comm">as any Jew would have felt</span>) that he ought to clear himself before the rulers 
                of his people, the man, no doubt, honestly thought that the name and authority 
                of the great Prophet of Nazareth would end all question as to the conduct of 
                both Healer and healed. If so, he was sadly mistaken.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> And for this cause 
            the Jews persecuted Jesus (<span class="comm">Literally, pursued, or hunted Jesus. This is 
                John's first plain declaration of open hostility to Jesus, though he has 
                already implied it. From this point the blood red line of conspiracy against 
                the life of Jesus runs through this Gospel</span>), because he did these 
            things on the sabbath.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> But Jesus answered them, My Father 
            worketh even until now, and I work. (<span class="comm">The dual nature of Jesus permitted 
                both a divine and human attitude toward the sabbath. We have shown that Jesus 
                chose to assert his divine attitude, for in no other matter did these Jews have 
                clearer distinction as to the difference between divine and human right than in 
                this matter of sabbath observance. If Jesus was a mere man, their ideas of law 
                clearly condemned him; but if Jesus were indeed God, their knowledge of divine 
                conduct in the whole realm of nature 

                clearly justified him, and 
                the miracle asserted his divine control in nature's realm. While God rested 
                from creation on the sabbath, nothing can be clearer than that in works of 
                sustenance, reproduction, healing and providence, God has never rested, and 
                never made distinctions between the days of our week. In the light of the 
                gospel we find also that his redemptive work has never ceased and, considering 
                the part which Jesus was even then accomplishing in this field of labor, his 
                words, "and I work," are full of meaning.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> For this cause 
            therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the 
            sabbath (<span class="comm">Not only violated, but denied its authority over his divine 
                nature</span>), but also called God his own Father, making himself equal 
            with God. (<span class="comm">They rightly interpreted Jesus as asserting relationship to God 
                differing from that sustained by others, as expressed in some few passages in 
                the Old Testament, where God is spoken of as a Father to the people generally; 
                i. e., their Creator. No man could claim such unity of nature as would 
                exempt him from the obligation of the fourth commandment. Had they 
                misunderstood Jesus in this all-important point, how quickly would he have 
                corrected them, for he could not have been less righteous than Paul and 
                Barnabas--<span class="style7">Acts 14: 11-15</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them. (<span class="comm">His answer is a 
                connected address, the theme being his own character, mission, authority, and 
                credentials as the Son of God. It is the Christology of Jesus, and instead of 
                being a retraction of the claim to divinity which the Jews accused him of 
                making, it is a complete and amplified reassertion of it, so that Luther fitly 
                called it "a sublime apology, which makes the matter worse." Jesus 
                first declares his relations to the Father (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 19-23</span></span>), which are set forth in four divisions, each of which 
                is introduced by the word "for;" viz.: 1. Unity of action. 2. Unity 
                of love, counsel, and plan. 3. Unity in life-impartation. 4. Unity in judgment, 
                resulting in unity of honor. This last division formed a turning-point in the 
                discourse. Since there is there unity of honor, it is important that men should 
                honor Jesus, 

                and also otherwise sustain right relationships to 
                him, and Jesus therefore, to enlighten the Jews as to their duty toward him, 
                proceeds to set forth his relations to men (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 23-30</span></span>), which he also gives in four divisions, closely 
                correlative to his four statements as to the Father, thus: 1. Right to receive 
                divine honor from men. 2. Authority to execute life and death judgment over 
                men. 3. Power of life-impartation as to men, and that both spiritually and 
                literally. 4. All Jesus' relationships to man to be sustained and executed 
                according to the will and plan or mission of God. But since all these various 
                relationships grow out of his divine nature, Jesus next submits the credentials 
                which establish his claim to such a nature (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 31-39</span></span>). These also are given in four divisions; namely: 1. 
                Testimony of the Baptist. 2. Testimony of the Father. 3. Jesus' own works and 
                ministry. 4. Testimony of Scripture. Or we may regard Jesus as asserting that 
                the Father testifies to the Son's divinity in four different ways; that is, 
                "God is properly the sole and original testifier, and all others are his 
                signatures and seals." The discourse then closes with an application of 
                its truth to the Jewish auditors (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 40-47</span></span>). They are told that all this truth is lost on them 
                because of their own fourfold sinful condition, which is thus stated: 1. Want 
                of will to come to Christ. 2. Want of real love toward God, or desire for his 
                honor. 3. Love for the honor of men, rather than the honor of God. 4. Want of 
                real faith in the Mosaic writings</span>), Verily, verily, I say unto you, 
            The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what 
            things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner. (<span class="comm">The Jews 
                regarded Jesus as claiming equality with God in a vain-glorious, honor-seeking 
                spirit; but Jesus restates himself, so as to show that the claim is really a 
                renunciation or abdication of all independent greatness--as having an 
                equality exercised in absolute subservience (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 42: 1; Philippians 3: 6-9</span></span>). They had accused him as a human 
                being acting contrary to the law of the Father. But he declares himself to be a 
                divine being, so united to the Father as to have no will or action apart from 
                the Father, a condition the resultant of which is 

                not weakness and insufficiency, but the strength and perfection arising from an absolute and 
                indissoluble union with the Father--the glory of divinity. Chrysostom 
                remarks, "Just as when we say, it is impossible for God to do wrong, we 
                do not impute to him any weakness, but confess in him an unutterable power, so 
                also when Christ saith, 'I can of mine own self do nothing,' the meaning is 
                that it is impossible--my nature admits not--that I should do 
                anything contrary to the Father." Jesus asserts his equality with the 
                Father in such a way as not to depreciate the dignity and glory of the Father.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel. (<span class="comm">The words here indicate that the love of the Father towards the Son was source of revelation, and that the revelation was progressive. Love constrained the Father to reveal, and love in turn constrained the Son to act according to the revelation. Moreover, this unity of love would be evidenced by greater works in the future, of which two are enumerated; namely, resurrection and judgment, the former being at first spiritually and afterwards literally outlined. The Father would show these works to the Son by causing him to do them; there would be no separate act of the Father so that the works would be twice performed. These works would produce faith in those of right spirit. But among such hardened hearts as those whom Jesus addressed they would only produce wonder and consternation. Those who withheld the tribute of faith should pay that of amazement. Putting the statements of <span class="style7">John 5: 19, 20</span> together, we find that the Son knows all that the Father does, and likewise does all that the Father does, and in like manner. There could be no higher assertion or equality than this; in fact, it asserts identity rather than equality. But the equality is not the result of conquest, nor was it one of power opposed to power, but is freely given and accorded by reason of love.</span>)
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son 
            also giveth life to whom he will. (<span class="comm">Since the verbs in this 

                verse are in the present tense, and since Jesus is not known to have raised the 
                physically dead before this time, it is rightly taken that he her speaks only 
                of raising the spiritually dead, our miserable existence in sin being often 
                spoken of in Scripture as a death from which we must be revived (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Eph. 2: 1-5; Col. 2: 13; Rev. 3: 1</span></span>). The use 
                of the word "will" likewise indicates a spiritual resurrection, for 
                Christ exercised a discrimination in such resurrections; but the final, literal 
                resurrection is without discrimination. See the word "all" in 
                <span class="style7">John 5: 28</span>. The meaning, therefore, is 
                that as the Father performs physical resurrections, so the Son (<span class="comm">for the 
                    present</span>) performs spiritual resurrections (<span class="comm">to be followed by physical 
                    resurrections</span>). Jesus later gave those at Jerusalem a sign of his power to 
                literally raise the dead by the resurrection of Lazarus. Resurrection is 
                bestowed or withheld according to Jesus' will, but his will is not arbitrarily 
                exercised. He visits those who receive him, and revives those who believe him. 
                If the Son possessed right of concurrent action on these lofty planes, 
                concurrent use of the sabbath was a small matter indeed.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> For neither 
            doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son. 
            (<span class="comm">That is to say, the Father does not act in judgment without the Son, nor the 
                Son without the Father, for in no work is either isolated from the other. 
                Resurrection is nearly always associated with judgment, and in this instance it 
                is in reviving that the judgment is manifested or executed. (<span class="comm">See verse 29 also.</span>) Note that judgment begins in this 
                world--<span class="style7">John 9: 39</span></span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. (<span class="comm">"Even 
                as" means in the same manner and in equal degrees. The prerogative of 
                judgment was committed unto Jesus that men might behold his true majesty. If 
                this verse does not teach us to worship Jesus as God, language can not teach 
                it, for God gives not his glory unto another (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 42: 8</span></span>), nor could he, by reason of his very nature, arbitrarily 
                will such honor to one whose character and nature were unworthy of it. In these 
                words Jesus exposed the ruinous attitude assumed by the Jews in seeking to slay 
                him.</span>) 

            He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that 
            sent him. (<span class="comm">Honor paid to the Father pertains or belongs to his nature and 
                character. But the Son is the manifestation of that nature and character 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 14: 7-11; Hebrews 1: 3</span></span>). Therefore to fail to honor the Son is to fail to honor the Father. Experience 
                shows it to be the rule that only those who honor Jesus take pains to honor the 
                Father.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and 
            believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life. And cometh not into judgment, 
            but hath passed out of death into life. (<span class="comm">Eternal life is a present gift, 
                just as condemnation is a present condition (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 3: 18</span></span>). To "hear" means in this case to receive and 
                obey, so that eternal life is conditioned upon a knowledge of the revelation of 
                the Father and Son, and a right use of that knowledge. Those who have learned 
                of and obey Jesus have already escaped or avoided the judgment--<span class="style7">Romans 8: 1</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Verily, verily, I say unto 
            you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son

                <span class="style7">John 5: 24</span> and the "now is" 
                of this verse show that Jesus is, thus far, primarily speaking of a present and 
                hence a spiritual resurrection, or regeneration. Christianity, or the 
                dispensation of regeneration, was to formally begin at Pentecost, but it was 
                already present in a preliminary form in the teaching of Jesus, for those who 
                hearkened to it were counted as already redeemed. Yet the spiritual condition 
                of even the apostles was at that time such that the hour of grace is spoken of 
                as more future than present--more "coming" than "at 
                hand."</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to 
            the Son also to have life in himself (<span class="comm">Not only an independent life, such as 
                man does not possess (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 2: 27-28</span></span>), 
                but a life which is a source of life to others. This regenerating power 
                completed Jesus' official status as judge, so that wherever he awarded life, he 
                could at the same time bestow it</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> and he gave him authority to 
            execute judgment, because he is a son of man. (<span class="comm">We can see several reasons, 


                humanly speaking, why the humanity of Jesus should be made a 
                ground for committing the judgment of the races of men to him: 1. Jesus having 
                experienced our infirmities and temptations, we can feel sure of his sympathy 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 4: 15-16</span></span>). 2. Jesus, partaking 
                of the nature of both God and man, is, because of his unique nature, the only 
                fit daysman or umpire between them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Job 9: 33</span></span>). Possibly we may regard it as a reward of 
                humility--<span class="style7">Philippians 2: 8-9</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> Marvel not at this (<span class="comm">Jesus seems to here answer the surprised expression of 
                their faces by enlarging his statements</span>): for the hour cometh, in the 
            which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> and shall 
            come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they 
            that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment. (<span class="comm">We have here the 
                future, literal, and final resurrection (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Daniel 12: 2</span></span>); a scene of such stupendous grandeur as to overshadow all the 
                marvelous in all that Christ shall have previously done.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> I can of myself 
            do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek 
            not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. (<span class="comm">Jesus here reasserts 
                his dependence upon the Father, not as a bare repetition of his relationship to 
                the Father, but for the purpose of developing his relationship to men as based 
                on or growing out of this relationship to the Father. The Jews, as they 
                listened to him, were conscious that he was even then judging and passing 
                sentence of condemnation upon them. Jesus does not deny the correctness of this 
                view, but shows that, because of his relationship or dependence upon the 
                Father, they are getting perfect justice, for: 1. His judgment was free from 
                all personal bias and selfish retaliation, and was, 2. Positively perfect, 
                being wholly inspired by the Father's will.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> If I bear witness of myself, 
            my witness is not true.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> It is another (<span class="comm">i. e., the 
                Father; for similar reference, see <span class="style7">John 8: 50-54</span></span>) that beareth witness of me; and I know that the 
            witness which he witnesseth of me is true. (<span class="comm">These two verses form, as 
                noted, a transition in the discourse. 

                In them Jesus passes from discussing himself and the divine and human phases of his nature and office to 
                take up the evidences which attest him, first asserting that the truth of what 
                he has said does not rest solely on his own veracity. There is here an indirect 
                reference to that clause of the Jewish law which required two witnesses. See <span class="style7">John 8: 14-18</span>. But the 
                saying is deeply spiritual. Since Jesus did nothing of himself, his very 
                testimony was not his own, but was the Father's who sent him, and was therefore 
                absolutely true in the consciousness of Jesus. If Jesus had testified 
                independently of the Father--had it been possible--it would have been 
                in the nature of the case contrary to that consensus of the divine will which 
                forms the truth.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> Ye have sent unto John (<span class="comm">this shows that Jesus was 
                addressing the rulers--<span class="style7">John 1: 19</span></span>), and he hath borne witness unto the truth. (<span class="comm">John had witnessed 
                the truth concerning the Messiahship of Jesus. Some think that the pronoun 
                "another" in verse 32 
                refers to John also, but by the present tense "witnesseth" of that 
                verse, and the past tense "hath borne witness" of this verse, the 
                ever-abiding testimony of the Father is contrasted with the finished testimony 
                of John, who is now silenced by imprisonment.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> But the witness which I 
            receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved. 
            (<span class="comm">In the light of <span class="style7">John 1: 6-7</span>, it sounds 
                strange to hear Jesus thus renounce the testimony of the Baptist. But the 
                phrase, "is not from man," is the Hebrew negative, meaning not 
                from man alone. Jesus therefore meant to accept it, as he in the next 
                breath did that of Moses, as prophetic--as the testimony of the Father 
                spoken through a human medium; but meant to reject it as a merely human 
                testimony, such as it was in the view of these Jews who denied in their hearts 
                that John was a prophet. This mission of Jesus was not to be proved by 
                uninspired testimony, for uninspired man can not testify of God from lack of 
                full and adequate knowledge (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 11: 27; 16: 17</span></span>). And yet if the Jews were willing to accept such testimony, 
                Jesus in kindness would permit it, that by any fair means they might believe 
                and be saved.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were 
            willing to rejoice for a 

            season in his light. (<span class="comm">They 
                were willing, like children, to play in John's light without stopping to 
                seriously consider its meaning, but when he bore testimony to Christ they 
                blasphemed him--<span class="style7">Luke 7: 33</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> But the witness which I have is greater than 
            that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to 
            accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath 
            sent me. (<span class="comm">By "greater witness" Jesus means testimony which is 
                more convincing. All divine testimony is of equal veracity, but some it is more 
                obviously convincing. The less the testimony savors of humanity, and the more 
                purely divine it appears, the more convincing it is (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 5: 9</span></span>). The term "works" is not to be 
                confined to miracles, for the word "accomplish" indicates a wider 
                meaning. The entire Messianic mission or redemptive work which ended with our 
                Lord's words, "It is finished" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 17: 4; 19: 30</span></span>), and which is indicated in this very discourse in 
                verse 20, and outlined by referring to 
                spiritual judgment and regeneration, should be included. Christ's transforming 
                grace still witnesses to Jew and Gentile that the Father sent him, for it it 
                manifests the love of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 3: 16</span></span>). The Father did not send the Son to merely work miracles, but to redeem the 
                world.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have

            have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.

                in the Old Testament Scriptures. 3. Through the Son and his works. Jesus here 
                asserts that all testimony of the first kind had failed to reach the Jewish 
                rulers; that the testimony of the second kind has been utterly lost upon them, 
                for they failed to see its accordance with the testimony of the third kind 
                which he was even then exhibiting to them, neither had it taught them to expect

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> and ye will not come to me, that ye may 
            have life. (<span class="comm">"Hillel used to say, More law, more life. . . . He who 
                has gotten himself words of law has gotten himself the life of the world to 
                come" (<span class="comm">Talmud</span>). In their zeal for the Scriptures the Jews had 
                counted every letter of them, expecting to find life in the laws and precepts, 
                but failed to find Him of whom the Scriptures spoke in figure, type and 
                prophecy. In their reverence for the Book they failed to see that it was a mere 
                means intended to acquaint them with him through whom life was to come. Hence, 
                as Canon Cook suggests, there is deep pathos in the co-ordination 
                "and--and." The verses give us three points worthy of deepest 
                reflection: 1. Protestantism may love the Book and show a martyr's loyalty to 
                it, and yet fail utterly to render any acceptable love or loyalty toward the 
                Being revealed in the Book. 2. Criticism, both higher and lower, may submit 
                every text to microscopic investigation, and yet be as blind as the ancient 
                Pharisees to its true meaning. It is profoundly true that the things of the 
                Spirit are spiritually discerned (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 2: 14</span></span>), and that pride of literary culture, and the self-worship of 
                intellectualism tend to spiritual blindness. It seems to come upon such a 
                visitation from God, as in the case of Elymas (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 11: 25; 15: 14; Luke 8: 10; Ephesians 4: 17-18; Isaiah 5: 21</span></span>). 
                3. Though free will is meant to be man's crowning glory, yet it may result in 
                his shame and ruin.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> I receive not glory from men. (<span class="comm">Jesus here shows 
                that his rebuke of their disbelief does not spring from personal pique or 
                disappointed ambition. He came seeking faith that he might save, not honor that 
                he might be glorified, and honor paid to him is by him transferred to God 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Philippians 2: 10-11</span></span>), just as honor paid 
                to the true Christian is transferred to Christ.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> But I know you, that ye 
            have not the love of God in yourselves. (<span class="comm">He speaks as the Searcher of 
                hearts (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 47-50; 2: 24-25</span></span>). Knowing them absolutely, he found them to be self-worshipers, 
                devoid 

                of that love Godward which begets belief, and lacking in 
                their natures that which would enable them to understand him and his spirit, no 
                matter what evidence was submitted to them.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span> I am come in my Father's 
            name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will 
            receive. (<span class="comm">Some think that this is spoken primarily of a pre-eminently great 
                antichrist who is yet to come and deceive many of the Jews, and who, as Stier 
                thinks, shall be such an incarnation of Satan as Jesus was of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 13: 1-9</span></span>). But they have already 
                received many false christs with joy. According to Schudt, as quoted by Bengel, 
                there have been sixty-four antichrists who have misled the Jews. Among them Bar 
                Cocheba led 24,000 to ruin, including Akiba, the President of the Sanhedrim. 
                False christs come in their own name--for their own honor--and make 
                no war on bosom sins, but upon earthly enemies; but Jesus came not to manifest 
                himself, but his Father.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> How can ye believe, who receive glory one of 
            another, and the glory that cometh 
            from the only God ye seek not? (<span class="comm">The question was as to their believing 
                Jesus to be the Messiah. Expecting one who would bring great honor to 
                themselves by his triumphs over his foes, and seeing nothing of this kind to be 
                expected from Jesus, they could not believe him to be the Messiah.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> Think 
            not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you,
            even Moses, on whom ye have set 
            your hope. (<span class="comm">Jesus here assumes that the Jews gave enough credence to his 
                words to fear that he might hereafter appear as their accuser. But Jesus 
                designs to appear rather as Advocate than as Prosecutor (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 2: 1</span></span>). It was their fault that he was not their 
                Advocate.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of 
            me.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my 
            words? (<span class="comm">In these verses Jesus explicitly endorses the Mosaic authorship and 
                authenticity of the Pentateuch, and sets forth one purpose for which Moses 
                wrote it. Jesus was the essential subject of the law and prophets (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 24: 27, 44-46; Romans 16: 25-26</span></span>). 

                The emphasis is on "his writings" and "my 
                words." They professed to reverence Moses and to receive his writings, 
                while they openly despised Jesus and repudiated his words as fast as he spoke 
                them. The phrase "wrote concerning me" is not to be restricted to <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 18: 15-18</span>. Moses 
                wrote symbolically of Jesus through his entire work, as Bengel tersely puts it, 
                "Everywhere!" The Epistle to the Hebrews is a partial elaboration 
                of the Christology of Moses. But there is doubtless a depth of meaning in the 
                Pentateuch which has never yet been fully fathomed, for there is a fullness in 
                Scripture greatly exceeding the popular conception. Moreover, the Old and New 
                Testaments are so linked together that to reject one is eventually to reject 
                the other, or to read it with veiled eyes--<span class="style7">2 Corinthians 3: 15</span>.</span>)
