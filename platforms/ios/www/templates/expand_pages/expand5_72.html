        <h3>72. THE TWELVE SENT OUT.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 9: 35-38; 10: 1, 5-42; 11: 1;  MARK 6: 6-13;  LUKE 9: 1-6.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 6</span> And he  Jesus went about  all the cities and villages, 
            teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and 
            healing all manner sickness and all manner of sickness. (<span class="comm">In the first 
                circuit of Galilee some of the twelve accompanied Jesus as disciples (<span class="comm">see Section 33.</span>); in the second the twelve were with him as 
                apostles; in the third they, too, are sent forth as evangelists to supplement 
                his work.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 9: 36</span> But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion 
            for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a 
            shepherd. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest indeed 
            is plenteous, but the 

            laborers are few. 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> 
            Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers 
            into his harvest. (<span class="comm">These verses contain the reasons why Jesus separated his 
                apostles from himself, and scattered them among the people. The masses of the 
                people of Galilee had been deeply stirred by the teaching and miracles of 
                Jesus, but they knew not as yet what direction was to be given to this popular 
                movement. They were in a bewildered state, like shepherdless sheep, scattered 
                over the hills and faint from running. The twelve were to assist him as 
                undershepherds in gathering these sheep. In the second figure Jesus likens the 
                people to a ripened harvest, and he sends the apostles among them as reapers 
                who shall garner them.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 1</span> And he called {
            calleth}  together  unto him 
            his {the}  twelve 
            disciples,  and he gave them  
            power and authority over all demons,  over the unclean 
            spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease {to cure diseases.}  and all manner of 
            sickness. (<span class="comm">At this point Matthew gives the names of the apostles, a 
                complete list of which will be found at page 222.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 10: 5</span> These twelve Jesus sent 
            forth  and he began to send them forth by two and 
            two (<span class="comm">He sent them in pairs because: 1. Under the law it required two 
                witnesses to establish the truth. 2. They could supplement each other's work. 
                Different men reach different minds, and where one fails another may succeed. 
                3. They would encourage one another. When one grew despondent the zeal and 
                enthusiasm of the other would quicken his activities</span>);  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 2</span> And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to 
            heal the sick.  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 8</span> and he charged them 
            that they should take nothing for their
            journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no money in their 
            purse; 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> but to go 
            shod with sandals; and, said he, 
            put not on two coats.  and charged them, saying, Go not 
            into any way of the Gentiles, 
            and enter not into any city of the Samaritans: 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 10: 6</span> but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. (<span class="comm">This first commission restricted Christ's messengers to the Jewish people, and the parts of Palestine which they inhabited, but his second commission impelled them to go everywhere and to preach to every creature (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 16: 15</span></span>). As Jesus himself was sent only to 
                the Jews, so during his days on earth he sent his disciples only to them.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. (<span class="comm">It was set up about a year later, on the day of Pentecost, under the direction of the Holy Spirit--</span><span class="style7">Acts 2</span>. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> Heal the 
            sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: freely ye received, 
            freely give. (<span class="comm">Here is the true rule of giving. Paul repeats it at 
                <span class="style7">1 Corinthians 16: 2</span>. If we would obey this rule, we 
                would make this a happy world.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 3</span> And he said unto 
            them, Take nothing for your journey,  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 10: 9</span> Get you no gold, nor silver, nor money;nor brass in your purses; neither staff, nor wallet, for your journey, nor bread, neither have two coats. nor shoes, nor staff: for the workman is worthy of his food. (<span class="comm">The prohibition is against securing these things before starting, and at their own expense. It is not that they would have no need for the articles mentioned, but that &quot;the laborer is worthy of his food,&quot; and they were to depend on the people for whose benefit they labored, to furnish what they might need. This passage is alluded to by Paul (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 9: 14</span></span>). To rightly understand 
                this prohibition we must remember that the apostles were to make but a brief 
                tour of a few weeks, and that it was among their own countrymen, among a people 
                habitually given to hospitality; moreover, that the apostles were imbued with 
                powers which would win for them the respect of the religious and the gratitude 
                of the well-to-do. The special and temporary commission was, therefore, never 
                intended as a rule under which we are to act in preaching the gospel in other 
                ages and in other lands.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> And he said unto 
            them  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And into whatsoever city or 
            village ye shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye 
            go forth. (<span class="comm">The customs of the East gave rise to this rule. The ceremonies 
                and forms with which a guest was received were tedious and time-consuming 
                vanities, while the mission of the apostles required haste.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And as ye 
            enter 

            come into an house, salute it. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. (<span class="comm">The form of salutation on entering a house was, &quot;Peace to this house.&quot; The apostles are told to salute each house, and are assured that the peace prayed for shall return to them if the house is not worthy; that is, they shall receive, in this case, the blessing pronounced on the house.</span>) Wheresoever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence. {<span class="style5">Luke 9: 4</span> And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.}



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 11</span> And whatsoever place shall not receive you, and they hear

                pleasant</span>),  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 10: 14</span> And whosoever as many as shall receive you not, nor hear your words,as ye go forth thence, out of that house or that city (<span class="comm">The word &quot;house&quot; indicates a partial and the word &quot;city&quot; a complete rejection</span>), {when you depart from that city,} shake off the dust that is under your feet {of your feet.} from your feet for a testimony unto them. against them. (<span class="comm">The dust of heathen lands as compared with the land of Israel was regarded as polluted and unholy (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Amos 2: 7; Ezekiel 27: 30</span></span>). The Jew, therefore, 
                considered himself defiled by such dust. For the apostles, therefore, to shake 
                off the dust of any city of Israel from their clothes or feet was to place that 
                city on a level with the cities of the heathen, and to renounce all further 
                intercourse with it.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> Verily I say unto you, It 
            shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of

            send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as

                first, or temporary, to the second, or final, commission of the apostles, for 
                all the persecutions enumerated were encountered under the latter.</span>)

                the intense religious bigotry with which his ministers should be opposed. 
                Having foretold persecution, he here predicts actual martyrdom.</span>)

            shall be hated of all men for my name's sake (<span class="comm">The term "all" is 
                used in its general and not in its absolute sense. The apostles had some few 
                friends among the unbelievers. Jesus gives the exact cause of the hatred. It 
                would not be because of any personal faults or peculiarities, but simply 
                because of adherence to Christ</span>): but he that endureth to the end, the 
            same shall be saved. (<span class="comm">Since the persecution was unto death, the endurance

                apostles were not to meet obduracy with obduracy. Moving as swiftly as they 
                could along the line of least resistance, they would not be able to evangelize 
                all the Jewish cities before the time set for their desolation--before the 
                Son of man should come in the demonstration of his judicial power and destroy

                similar words to the Jewish teachers. See page 262.</span>) If they have

            household! (<span class="comm">Jesus here warns the apostles that they can not expect better 
                treatment than he himself received--no, not so good. Nor should they ask

                their religions at a higher value than the ties of kindred, much more

                the first of the kind it must have been very puzzling to his disciples, unless 
                explained by prior words of Jesus, of which we have no record. As such allusion 
                its full meaning is this: "If I bear for each the vicarious cross and 
                suffer for each the full measure of the divine displeasure, then each should be 
                willing cheerfully to follow me that he may obtain the benefits of my 
                sacrifice, and if the light cross of human displeasure deter him from this, he

                self-seeking is self-losing. He that makes his own life the chief object of his

                his powers to expend them on those lower carnal joys which a sinner calls

                act, just as he who performs a similar act in the name of a friend thereby 
                honors that friend. A prophet's reward is not synonymous, however, with final

When an apostle stood over a sick man to heal him by a touch or a word, he was about to send him out of his sick chamber, and just before the word was spoken, the oil was applied. It was, therefore, no more than a token or symbol that the man was restored to his liberty, and was from that moment to be confined to his chamber no longer. Compare <span class="style7">James 5: 14</span>. 
                This practice bears about the same relation to the Romish practice of extreme 
                unction as the Lord's Supper does to the mass, or as a true baptism does to the 
                sprinkling of an infant.</span>)
