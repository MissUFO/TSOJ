        <h3>38. JESUS DEFENDS DISCIPLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY WHILE ON THE WAY FROM JERUSALEM TO GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 12: 1-8;  MARK 2: 23-28;  LUKE 6: 1-5.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 2: 23</span> And <span class="style5">Luke 6: 1</span> Now it came to 
            pass<span class="style5"> Matthew 12: 1</span> At that season that he Jesus went {was going} on the {a} sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began as they went, to pluck the ears.and to eat, and his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. (<span class="comm">This lesson fits in chronological order with the last, if the Bethesda events took place at Passover. The paschal lamb was eaten on the fourteenth Nisan, or about the first of April. Clark fixes the exact date as the 29th of March, in A.D. 28, which is the beginning of the harvest season. Barley ripens in the Jordan valley about the 1st of April, but on the uplands it is reaped as late as May. Wheat ripens from one to three weeks later than barley, and upland wheat (<span class="comm">and Palestine has many mountain plateaus</span>) is often harvested in June. If Scaliger is right, as most critics think he is, in fixing this sabbath as the first after the Passover, it is probable that it was barley which the disciples ate. Barley bread was and is a common food, and it is common to chew the grains of both it and wheat.</span>)
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 2; Luke 6: 2</span> But {<span class="style5">Mark 2: 24</span> And}  certain of the Pharisees  when they saw 
            it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon 
            the sabbath.  why do they on the sabbath day that which 
            is not lawful?  Why do ye that which it is not lawful 
            to do on the sabbath day? (<span class="comm">The Pharisees did not object to the act of 
                taking the grain. Such plucking of the grain was allowed by the law (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 23: 25</span></span>) and is still practiced by hungry 
                travelers in Palestine, which is, and has always been, an unfenced land, the 
                roads, or rather narrow paths, of which lead through the grainfields, so that 
                the grain is in easy reach of the passer-by. The Pharisees objected to the 
                plucking of grain because they considered it a kind of reaping, and therefore 
                working on the sabbath day. The scene shows the sinlessness of Jesus in 
                strong light. Every slightest act of his was submitted to a microscopic 
                scrutiny.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 3; Luke 6: 3</span> But {<span class="style5">Mark 2: 25</span> And} Jesus answering them  
            said unto them, Have ye not read {Did ye never 
            read}  even this (<span class="comm">There is a touch of irony here. 
                The Pharisees prided themselves upon their knowledge of Scriptures, but they 
                had not read (<span class="comm">so as to understand them</span>) even its most common incidents</span>), 
            what David did,  when he had need, and was hungry, 
            he, and they that were with him?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 2: 26</span> How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest,  and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were 
            with him; which it is not lawful to eat {which it was 
            not lawful for him to eat,} neither for them that were with him, but only {save} for the priests alone? (<span class="comm">Jesus here refers to 
                the incident recorded at<span class="style7"> 1 Samuel 21: 1-6</span>. Ahimelech and Abiathar have been confused by 
                transcribers. It should read Ahimelech. However, we are not referred to the 
                actions of Abiathar, but to those of 

                David. He went with his 
                followers to the tabernacle at Nob near Jerusalem, and being hungry, asked 
                bread of the priests. There was no bread at hand save the showbread. This bread 
                was called showbread because it was "set out" or 
                "exhibited" before Jehovah. It consisted of twelve loaves, which 
                were baked upon the sabbath, and were placed, hot, in two rows upon the 
                showbread table every sabbath day. The twelve old loaves which were then 
                removed were to be eaten by the priests and no one else (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 24: 5-9</span></span>). It was these twelve old loaves which 
                were given to David (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Samuel 21: 6</span></span>). 
                Since the showbread was baked on the sabbath, the law itself ordered work on 
                that day. The vast majority of commentators look upon this passage as teaching 
                that necessity abrogates what they are pleased to call the ceremonial laws of 
                God. Disregarding the so-called ceremonial laws of God is a very dangerous 
                business, as is witnessed by the case of Uzzah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Samuel 6: 6-7</span></span>), and Uzziah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Chronicles 26: 16-23</span></span>). Christ never did it, and strenuously 
                warned those who followed the example of the scribes and Pharisees in teaching 
                such a doctrine (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 5: 17-20</span></span>). The law of necessity was not urged by him as a justifiable excuse for making 
                bread during the forty days' fast of the temptation. Life is not higher than 
                law. "All that a man hath will he give for his life," is Satan's 
                doctrine, not Christ's (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Job 2: 4</span></span>). The 
                real meaning, as we understand it, will be developed below in our treatment of 
                verse 7, which verse refers 
                both to this incident and to the discussion in progress.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 5</span> Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in 
            the temple profane (<span class="comm">i. e., degrade and put to common use</span>) the 
            sabbath, and are guiltless? (<span class="comm">Having cited a passage from the prophets, 
                Jesus now turns to the law--the final authority. He also turns from a 
                parallel argument concerning sacred food to a direct argument concerning the 
                sacred day. The Sabbath was the busiest day in the week for the priests. They 
                baked and changed the showbread; they performed sabbatical sacrifices 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 28: 9</span></span>), and two lambs were 
                killed on the sabbath in addition to the daily 

                sacrifice. This 
                involved the killing, skinning, and cleaning of the animals, and the building 
                of the fire to consume the sacrifice. They also trimmed the gold lamps, burned 
                incense, and performed various other duties. The profanation of the Sabbath, 
                however, was not real, but merely apparent. Jesus cites this priestly work to 
                prove that the Sabbath prohibition was not universal, and hence might not 
                include what the disciples had done. The fourth commandment did not forbid work 
                absolutely, but labor for worldly gain. Activity in the work of God was both 
                allowed and commanded.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 6</span> But I say (<span class="comm">asserting his own authority</span>) 
            unto you, that one greater than the temple is here. (<span class="comm">The word 
                "greater" is in the neuter gender, and the literal meaning is 
                therefore "a greater thing than the temple." The contrast may be 
                between the service of the temple and the service of Christ, or it may 
                be a contrast between the divinity, sacredness, or divine atmosphere which 
                hallowed the temple, and the divinity or Godhead of Christ. But, however we 
                take it, the meaning is ultimately a contrast between Christ and the temple, 
                similar to the contrast between himself and Solomon, etc. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 12: 41-42</span></span>). It was a startling saying as 
                it fell on Jewish ears, for to them the temple at Jerusalem was the place 
                honored by the very Shekinah of the unseen God, and the only place of effective 
                worship and atonement. If the temple service justified the priests in working 
                upon the Sabbath day, much more did the service of Jesus, who was not only the 
                God of the temple, but was himself the true temple, of which the other was 
                merely the symbol, justify these disciples in doing that which was not legally, 
                but merely traditionally, unlawful. Jesus here indirectly anticipates the 
                priesthood of his disciples--<span class="style7">1 Pet. 2: 5</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 7</span> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and 
            not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. (<span class="comm">This passage is 
                quoted from<span class="style7"> Hosea 6: 6</span>, and is reiterated 
                at<span class="style7"> Matthew 9: 13</span>. It is an assertion of 
                the superiority of inward life over outward form, for the form is nothing if 
                the heart is wrong. The saying is first suggested by David himself (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 52: 16-17</span></span>), 

                after which it is 
                stated by Hosea and amplified by Paul (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 13: 3</span></span>). The quotation has a double reference both to David and the 
                disciples as above indicated. Having given the incident in the life of David, 
                Jesus passes on from it without comment, that he may lay down by another 
                example the principle which justified it. This principle we have just treated, 
                and we may state it thus: A higher law, where it conflicts with a lower one, 
                suspends or limits the lower one at the point of conflict. Thus the higher laws 
                of worship in the temple suspended the lower law of sabbath observance, and 
                thus also the higher law of mercy suspended the lower law as to the showbread 
                when David took it and mercifully gave it to his hungry followers, and when God 
                in mercy permitted this to be done. And thus, had they done what was otherwise 
                unlawful, the disciples would have been justified in eating by the higher law 
                of Christ's service. And thus also would Christ have been justified in 
                permitting them to eat by the law of mercy, which was superior to that which 
                rendered the seventh day to God as a sacrifice.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 8</span> For the Son of man is 
            Lord of the sabbath.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 2: 27</span> And he said unto 
            them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 2: 28</span> so that the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath. (<span class="comm">The 
                expression "Son of man" is used eighty-eight times in the New 
                Testament, and always means the Messiah, and not man generally. The Sabbath was 
                made for man's convenience and blessing, and so Jesus, who was complete and 
                perfect manhood, was Lord of it. But men who were incomplete and imperfect in 
                their manhood, can not trust their fallible judgment to tamper with it. Though 
                the day was made for man, this fact would not entitle man to use it contrary to 
                the laws under which it was granted. As Lord of the day Jesus had a right to 
                interpret it and to apply it, and to substitute the Lord's day for it. In 
                asserting his Lordship over it, Jesus takes the question outside the range of 
                argument and brings it within the range of authority.</span>)
