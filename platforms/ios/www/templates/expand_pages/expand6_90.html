        <h3>90. THE STORY OF THE ADULTERESS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 7: 53-8: 11.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4">(<span class="comm">This section is wanting in nearly all older manuscripts, but Jerome (<span class="comm">A.D. 346-420</span>) says that in his 
                time it was contained in "many Greek and Latin manuscripts," and 
                these must have been as good or better than the best manuscripts we now 
                possess. But whether we regard it as part of John's narrative or not, scholars 
                very generally accept it as a genuine piece of history.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 7: 53</span> And they went every man unto his own house (<span class="comm">confused by the 
                question of Nicodemus, the assembly broke up and each man went home</span>):

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8: 1</span> but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. (<span class="comm">Probably crossing the mountain 
                to the house of Lazarus and sisters.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And early in the morning he came 
            again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down 
            (<span class="comm">as an authoritative teacher did--<span class="style7">Matthew 5: 1</span></span>), and taught them.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And the scribes and 
            the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the 
            midst,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in 
            adultery, in the very act. (<span class="comm">The woman had probably been brought to the 
                rulers for trial, and they had seen in her case what appeared to be a promising 
                means of entrapping Jesus. In the presence of the woman and the form of their 
                accusation we see their coarse brutality. The case could have been presented to 
                Jesus without the presence of the woman, and without a detailed accusation.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such (<span class="comm">It was a case under <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 22: 22</span>. Stoning was the 
                legal method of capital punishment</span>): what then sayest thou of her?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And this they said, trying him, that they might have whereof to accuse him. (<span class="comm">They were 
                placing Jesus in a dilemma. They reasoned that he 

                could not set 
                aside the law of Moses and clear the woman without so losing the confidence and 
                favor of the people as to frustrate his claim to be Messiah. They thought he 
                would therefore be compelled to condemn the woman. But if he ordered her to be 
                put to death, he would be assuming authority which belonged only to the Roman 
                rulers, and could therefore be accused and condemned as a usurper.</span>) But 
            Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. (<span class="comm">His act was 
                intended to make them vehement, and to give his answer greater effect. What he 
                wrote is unimportant and immaterial, and hence was not told.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> But when 
            they continued asking him (<span class="comm">they insisted on an answer, hoping that he would 
                so explain away the seventh commandment as to encourage them in breaking the 
                sixth</span>), he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without 
            sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. (<span class="comm">Under the law (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 17: 7</span></span>), the witnesses were to cast the 
                first stone. Jesus maintained and vindicated the law, but imposed a condition 
                which they had overlooked. The one who executed the law must be free from the 
                same crime, lest by stoning the woman he condemn himself as worthy of a like 
                death. There is no doubt that the words of Jesus impressed upon them the truth 
                that freedom from the outward act did not imply inward purity or 
                sinlessness--<span class="style7">Matthew 5: 27-28</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. (<span class="comm">Thus 
                giving them the opportunity to retire without the embarrassment of being 
                watched.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning 
            from the eldest, even unto the 
            last (<span class="comm">the oldest was first to be convicted of his conscience, because his 
                experience of life's sinfulness was necessarily the fullest</span>): and 
            Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst. (<span class="comm">i. 
                e., in the midst of the court, where the crowd had been.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> And Jesus 
            lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn 
            thee? (<span class="comm">This question is asked to pave the way for the dismissal of the 
                woman.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And she said, No man, Lord. (<span class="comm">"Lord" is ambiguous; 
                it 

                may mean "Master" or simply "sir."</span>) 
            And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no 
            more. (<span class="comm">The woman did not ask forgiveness, so no words of pardon are spoken. 
                Compare this case with <span class="style7">Luke 12: 14</span>. Jesus did not come as an earthly judge; neither did he come to condemn, but to 
                save. The narrative shows how Jesus could deal with malice and impurity in a 
                manner so full of delicacy and dignity as to demonstrate the divine wisdom 
                which dwelt within him.</span>)
