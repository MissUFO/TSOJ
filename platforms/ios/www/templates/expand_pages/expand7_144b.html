        <h3>144B. THE CRUCIFIXION. JESUS CRUCIFIED</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">FRIDAY MORNING FROM 9 O'CLOCK TILL NOON.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 27: 35-44;  MARK 15: 24-32; <br>LUKE 23: 33-43;  JOHN 19: 18-27.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 25</span> And it was the third hour,  
            and  there {18 where}
            they crucified him. </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> And</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 38</span> Then are there crucified 
            {they crucify}  with him
            two others,  the malefactors,
            robbers, one on the right hand, and one {the other} on the {his} left.
            on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. (<span class="comm">These were 
                doubtless robbers of the class of Barabbas. They were those who, led on by 
                fanatical patriotism, had become insurrectionists and then outlaws. Large 
                numbers of them were crucified during the Jewish wars (<span class="comm">Jos. Wars, 13: 2. 3</span>). 
                These two may have been crucified at this time for convenience' sake, but the 
                fact that Jesus was placed between them suggests that they were crucified with 
                him to heighten his shame and indignity. For, though Pilate had no personal ill 
                will toward Jesus, he wished to show contempt for Judah's King.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 34</span> And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what 
            they do. (<span class="comm">Our Lord's prayer here reminds us of the word at Isa. 53: 12. It accords with his own teachings 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 5: 44</span></span>), and it was echoed by 
                Stephen (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 7: 59, 60</span></span>). Peter and 
                Paul both speak of the Jewish ignorance (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 3: 17; 1 Corinthians 2: 8</span></span>). Ignorance mitigates, but does not excuse, 
                crime.</span>) </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 24</span> And they crucify him,</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 23</span> The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, 
            took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part (<span class="comm">A 
                quaternion or band of four soldiers did the work of the actual crucifixion. The 
                Roman law awarded them the garments of the condemned as their perquisites</span>)
            ;  and part {parted
            parting}  his garments among them, 
            casting {they cast} lots. 

            upon them, what each should take. (<span class="comm">The sandals, girdle, outer 
                robe, head-dress, etc., of Jesus were divided into four parts and lots were 
                cast of the parts.</span>)   and also the coat: now the coat was 
            without seam, woven from the top throughout. (<span class="comm">This was the tunic or 
                undergarment. It reached from the shoulders to the knees. Ordinarily it was in 
                two pieces, which were fastened at the shoulders by clasps; but Josephus tells 
                us that the tunic of the high priest was an exception to this rule, being woven 
                without seam (<span class="comm">Ant. 3: 7. 4</span>). Thus in dividing the Lord's garments, they found 
                a suggestion of his high priesthood.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> They said therefore one to another, 
            Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture 
            might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon 
            my vesture did they cast lots. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalms 22: 18</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> These things therefore the soldiers did. (<span class="comm">Even their 
                small part was the subject of minute prophecy.</span>)   
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 36</span>  
            and they sat and watched him there. (<span class="comm">They were on guard to prevent any 
                attempt at rescue.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 19</span>  And Pilate wrote a title 
            also, and put it on the cross.  over him, </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 37</span> And they set up over 
            his head  the {a} 
            superscription  of his accusation written,  And there was written,  THIS IS
            JESUS  OF NAZARETH,THE KING OF THE JEWS. (<span class="comm">It was a well-established Roman custom 
                to thus place a writing above the heads of the crucified to indicate the cause 
                for which they died. Pilate writes the accusation so as to clear his own skirts 
                before C&aelig;sar and so as to show his contempt for the Jewish people. They 
                had forced him to crucify an innocent man, and he retaliates by giving to that 
                man the title which his enemies accused him of professing.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 20</span> This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place 
            where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in 
            Hebrew, and in Latin,
            and in Greek. (<span class="comm">These three 
                languages were respectively those of religion, law and philosophy; but Pilate 
                made use of them because all three were spoken by people then in Jerusalem.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to 

            Pilate, 
            Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. (<span class="comm">The rulers smarted under this title which Pilate had tauntingly written. They had insisted that Jesus' kingship was dangerous enough to justify his crucifixion; but now (<span class="comm">if politically and temporally interpreted</span>) they admit that his kingship was an idle claim, a mere matter of words.</span>)  
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 35</span> And the 
            people stood beholding. (<span class="comm">The scene had an awful fascination which they 
                could not resist.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 39</span> And they that passed by 
            [<span class="comm">Jesus was evidently crucified near the highway</span>] railed on him, wagging 
            their heads, 40 and saying,  Ha! Thou that 
            destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 30</span> Save 
            thyself,  if thou art the Son of God,  
            and come down from the cross.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> In like manner also the chief priests  And the 
            rulers also scoffed at him,  mocking him among themselves with the scribes
            and elders, said, {
            saying,} He saved others;  himself he cannot save.
            let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his 
            chosen.  He is the King of Israel; let him now come 
            down from the cross, and we will believe on him.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the 
            cross, that we may see and believe.  
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 43</span> He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I 
            am the Son of God.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 36</span> And the soldiers 
            also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> and 
            saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself. (<span class="comm">Thus one and all 
                unite in mocking Jesus, using both word and gesture. They bring forth echoes 
                from the trial of Jesus and take other incidents from his life, little dreaming 
                the deep significance of what they utter. They reminded Jesus of his words 
                about destroying the temple, when they were committing that very act. They 
                speak of his building it again when Jesus was about to die that he might rise. 
                They taunt him with saving others, yet being unable to save himself, which is 
                the great truth of the atonement which the Lord 

                was then making. 
                They promised to believe if he will come down from the cross, yet his being 
                lifted upon the cross was the very act which would convince 
                them <span class="style7">John 8: 28</span>.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 44</span> And the robbers also that were crucified with him
            reproached him.  cast upon him the 
            same reproach. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 39</span> And one of the 
            malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? 
            save thyself and us. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> But the other answered, and rebuking him 
            said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: 
            but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> And he said, Jesus, 
            remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span>  And he said unto 
            him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. (<span class="comm">It 
                seems that at first both robbers reviled Christ, but one repenting spoke in his 
                favor and prayed to him. It is not likely that this robber had any conception 
                of the spiritual kingdom of Jesus, but he somehow arrived at the conclusion 
                that Jesus was the Messiah, and would come into his kingdom despite his 
                crucifixion. Jesus answered his prayer by a solemn promise that they would, 
                that day, be together in that portion of the invisible world where those who 
                are accepted of God await the resurrection. Many thoughtlessly make this dying 
                robber the model of death-bed repentance, arguing that others may also be saved 
                in this irregular manner. But Christ had not yet died, and the new testament or 
                covenant was not sealed. Jesus then could change its terms to suit the 
                occasion. It is therefore no evidence whatever that after his death and in his 
                present glorified state our Lord will in any way change the covenant so as to 
                do away with a single one of the terms required for obtaining remission of sins 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 9: 15-18</span></span>). Moreover, 
                the example of the penitent robber is a difficult one to follow; he professed 
                faith in Christ and his kingdom when there was no other voice in the whole wide 
                world willing to do such a thing. Any one having such a faith in Christ will 
                not put off his confession until the hour of 

                death.</span>)   But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his 
            mother's sister, Mary the wife 
            of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. (<span class="comm">For comment on these four women, see note 
                on p. 225.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 26</span> Then Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple 
            standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that 
            hour the disciple took her unto his own home.
            (<span class="comm">By using the title "woman" Jesus addressed his mother 
                at the end of his ministry with the same word which he had used at its 
                beginning (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 2: 4</span></span>). Thus he cut her 
                off from all parental authority over him. In this last hour our Lord bestows 
                upon his helpless mother the disciple whom he loved, who was then in the flower 
                of his manhood. All of Christ's disciples are thus appointed by him protectors 
                of the helpless, but few recognize the behest as John did.</span>)
