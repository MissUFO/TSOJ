        <h3>86. JESUS' BROTHERS ADVISE HIM.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">GALILEE, PROBABLY CAPERNAUM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 7: 2-9.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, 
            was at hand. (<span class="comm">The first verse of this 
                chapter (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 7:1</span></span>) tells us that Jesus kept away from Jud&aelig;a because the 
                Jews sought for his life. See page 393. This keeping away or seclusion began at 
                the Passover season, and led Jesus not only to keep away from Jud&aelig;a, but 
                even to hover upon the outskirts of Galilee itself. This seclusion is described 
                in Sections 76-82. We now turn back to take up with John the narrative 
                which tells how, after his six months' retirement, Jesus prepared to appear 
                once more in Jud&aelig;a. The Feast of Tabernacles began on the 15th day of the 
                month Tisri, which answers to our September-October, and consequently came six 


                months after and six months before the Passover. It was the most 
                joyous of the two great feasts, and not only commemorated the time when Israel 
                dwelt in the wilderness in tents, but also celebrated the harvest home. It was, 
                therefore, a thanksgiving both for permanent abodes and for the year's crops. 
                As the people dwelt in booths, the feast partook much of the form and merriment 
                of a picnic.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go 
            into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> For no man doeth any thing in secret, and himself seeketh to be 
            known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world. 
            (<span class="comm">When we consider how Jesus had withdrawn into the regions of Tyre, Sidon, 
                Decapolis, and C&aelig;sarea Philippi, and with what assiduity he had avoided 
                crowds and concealed miracles, these words become very plain. The twelve had 
                been instructed sufficiently to confess his Messiahship, but thousands of his 
                disciples had not seen a miracle in six months. To his brothers such secrecy 
                seemed foolish on the part of one who was ostensibly seeking to be known. They 
                were not disposed to credit the miracles of Jesus, but insisted that if he 
                could work them he ought to do so openly.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> For even his brethren did not 
            believe on him. (<span class="comm">This verse explodes the idea that the parties known in the 
                New Testament as our Lord's brothers were the sons of Alph&aelig;us and cousins 
                to Jesus. The sons of Alph&aelig;us had long since been numbered among the 
                apostles, while our Lord's brothers were still unbelievers. As to his brothers, 
                see pp. 224-226, 360.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is 
            not yet come: but your time is always ready. (<span class="comm">Jesus is answering a request 
                that he manifest himself. The great manifestation of his cross and resurrection 
                could not properly take place before the Passover, which was still six months 
                distant. But his brothers, having no message and no manifestation, could show 
                themselves at Jerusalem any time.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> The world cannot hate you; but me it 
            hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. (<span class="comm">The world can 


                not hate you because you are in mind and heart a part of it, and 
                it can not hate itself. It hates those who are not of it, and who rebuke its 
                sins and oppose its ways.</span>)
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this 
            feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And having said 
            these things unto them, he abode still
            in Galilee. (<span class="comm">He did go to the feast, but he did not go up to 
                manifest himself, as his brothers asked, and hence, in the sense in which they 
                made the request, he did not go up. Six months later, at the Passover, he 
                manifested himself by the triumphal entry somewhat as his brothers wished.</span>)
