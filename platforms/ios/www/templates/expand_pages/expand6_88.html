        <h3>88. SACRIFICE FOR CHRIST'S SERVICE.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">SAMARIA. PROBABLY SEPTEMBER, A.D. 29.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 9: 57-62.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">57</span> And as they went on the way (<span class="comm">the way through 
                Samaria to Jerusalem</span>), a certain man said unto him, I will follow 
            thee whithersoever thou goest.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">58</span> And Jesus said unto him, The 
            foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven 
            have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his 
            head.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">59</span> And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, 
            suffer me first to go and bury my father.
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">60</span> Jesus said unto 


            him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and 
            preach the kingdom of God. (<span class="comm">For comment upon similar language see pp. 341, 
                342.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">61</span> And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer 
            me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">62</span> But Jesus said 
            unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for 
            the kingdom of God. (<span class="comm">Comparing Luke with Matthew, as indicated above, we 
                find that Matthew gives two and Luke three proposals to follow him, and that 
                they differ widely as to the time. It is likely that the first instance 
                occurred where Matthew places it, and the last two occurred where Luke places 
                them, and that each Evangelist borrowed an item from another period and joined 
                it to his incident because of the similarity of the subject. But as such 
                proffers of discipleship may have been very common, the incidents may be 
                entirely different. The teaching of the last incident is that at a command of 
                Christ all conflicting obligations must be set aside.</span>)
