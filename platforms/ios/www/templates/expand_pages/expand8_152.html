        <h3>152. EIGHTH APPEARANCE OF JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">A MOUNTAIN IN GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 28: 16, 17;  1 CORINTHIANS 15: 6.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 28: 16</span> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto 
            the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">I Corinthians 15: 6</span> then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the 
            greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 28: 17</span> And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted. (<span class="comm">Though Matthew speaks of only eleven being present at this appearance, yet as it was the oft-promised meeting by appointment and as the women and disciples generally shared in the promise (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 28: 7-10</span></span>), we have no doubt that it was the meeting mentioned by Paul the account of which we have here blended with Matthew. As to the doubts, we may explain them in three ways: 1. Among so large a number as five hundred some would likely be skeptical. 2. It would take Jesus some time to draw near enough to all to convince each one of his identity. Some, therefore, would doubt until they were thus convinced by Jesus coming to them and speaking to them, as the first clause of the next section shows that he did. 3. Matthew records no other appearance to the apostles save this one, and it seems to us reasonable to think that he here notes the doubts of Thomas, and connects them with the appearance of Jesus generally. He could not well say &quot;had doubted,&quot; for he records no other appearance where they had opportunity to doubt. The history of the eleven sustains this view, for there were no doubters among them at Pentecost. According to Paul, many of these brethren were still alive when he wrote his epistle to the Corinthians, which is commonly accepted to have been in the spring of A.D. 57.</span>)        </p>
