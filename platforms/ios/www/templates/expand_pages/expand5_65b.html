        <h3>65B. FIRST PARABLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">BESIDE THE SEA OF GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 13: 3-23;  MARK 4: 3-25;  LUKE 8: 5-18.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4">Behold, <span class="style5">Luke 8: 5</span> The 
            sower went forth to sow his seed (<span class="comm">Orientals live in cities and towns. 
                Isolated farmhouses are practically unknown. A farmer may therefore live 
                several miles from his field, in which case he literally "goes 
                forth" to it</span>):

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 4; Mark 3: 4</span> And it came to 
            pass, as he sowed, some seed 
            {seeds } 
            fell by the way side,  and it was trodden under foot, 
            and the birds of heaven  came and  
            devoured it up. {them:} (<span class="comm">Palestine is an 
                unfenced land, and the roads or paths lead through the fields. They are usually 
                trodden hard by centuries of use. Grain falling on them could not take root. 
                Its fate was either to be crushed by some foot, or to be carried off by some 
                bird.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And other {others} fell upon the rocky places,  on the rock;
            where it {they}  
            had not much earth; and straightway it {they}  sprang up, because it {they}  had no deepness of earth:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> and when the sun was risen, it was {they 
            were}  scorched; and because it {they}  had no root, it {they} withered away.  and as soon as it grew, it 
            withered away, because it had no moisture. (<span class="comm">This seed fell upon a ledge of 
                rock covered with a very thin coating of soil. Its roots were prevented by the 
                rock from striking down to the moisture, and so under the blazing Syrian sun it 
                died ere it had well begun to live.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And other 
            {others}  fell among {upon  amidst}  
            the thorns, and the thorns grew up,  with it,
            and 

            choked it, {them:}  and it yielded no fruit. (<span class="comm">Palestine 
                abounds in thorns. Celsius describes sixteen varieties of thorny plants. Porter 
                tells us that in the Plain of Gennesaret thistles grow so tall and rank that a 
                horse can not push through them.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And others {other}  fell into {upon}
            the good ground,  and grew, and 
            brought forth a hundredfold,  and yielded fruit, 
            growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a 
            hundredfold. {some a hundredfold, some sixty, some 
            thirty.} (<span class="comm">Thirty-fold is a good crop in Palestine, but it is asserted that 
                a hundred-fold has been reaped in the Plain of Esdraelon even in recent years. 
                These four several conditions of soil may be readily found lying close to each 
                other in the Plain of Gennesaret. A sowing like this described may have been 
                enacted before the eyes of the people even while Jesus was speaking.</span>)   As he said these things, he cried (<span class="comm">a method of emphasis 
                rarely employed by Jesus</span>),

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 9</span> And he 
            said, <span class="style5">Matthew 13: 9</span> He that {Who} hath ears to hear, let him hear. (<span class="comm">A saying often used by Jesus. He 
                intended it to prevent the people from regarding the parable as merely a 
                beautiful description. It warned them of a meaning beneath the surface, and 
                incited them to seek for it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 10</span> And when he was alone (<span class="comm">that is, after 
                he had finished speaking all the parables. The explanation of the parable is 
                put next to the parable to aid us in understanding it</span>),  
            the disciples came,  they that were about him 
            with the twelve

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 9</span> and his disciples
            asked him of the parables.  what 
            this parable might be.  and said unto him, Why speakest 
            thou unto them in parables? (<span class="comm">Their questions show that as yet parables were 
                unusual.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 11</span> And he answered and said unto them, Unto you is given to know 
            the mysteries {is given the mystery}of the kingdom of heaven, {of God:}
            but to them  the restit is not given. (<span class="comm">save</span>)   in 
            parables;  unto them that are without, all things are 
            done in parables. (<span class="comm">Jesus adapted his lessons to the condition of his 
                pupils; hence his disciples might know what the multitude must not yet know 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 2: 6-11</span></span>). 

                Jesus already drew a line of demarcation between disciples and 
                unbelievers; which line became more marked and visible after the church was 
                organized at Pentecost. The word "mystery" in current language 
                means that which is not understood; but as used in the Scriptures it means that 
                which is not understood because it has not been revealed, but which is plain as 
                soon as revealed. Bible mysteries are not unraveled by science, but are 
                unfolded by revelation--<span class="style7">Colossians 1: 26; 1 Timothy 3: 16; Matthew 11: 25-26; Revelation 17: 5; Daniel 2: 47</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall 
            have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that 
            which he hath. (<span class="comm">To understand this saying, we must remember that it was the 
                teaching of Jesus which was under discussion. In the beginning of his ministry 
                Jesus taught plainly, and all his hearers had equal opportunity to know his 
                doctrine and believe in him. But from now on his teaching would be largely 
                veiled in parables. These parables would enrich their knowledge and 
                understanding of the believers; but they would add nothing to the store of 
                unbelievers, and their efforts to understand the parables would withdraw their 
                minds from the truths which they had already learned, so that they would either 
                forget them or fail to profit by them. If we improve our opportunities, they 
                bring us to other and higher ones; but if we neglect them, even the initial 
                opportunities are taken away.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> Therefore speak I to them in parables:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 12</span> that seeing they may see, and not 
            perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; {that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.}
            because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, 
            neither do they understand.  lest haply they should 
            turn again, and it should be forgiven them.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 14</span> And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 6: 9-10</span></span>), which saith, By hearing 
            ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and 
            shall in no wise perceive:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> For this people's heart is waxed 
            gross, And their ears are dull of hearing. 

            And their eyes 
            they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear 
            with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, and I 
            should heal them. (<span class="comm">The language here is an elaboration of the thoughts 
                contained in <span class="style7">Matt. 13:12</span>. The 
                people saw Christ's miracles, but not in their true light; they heard his 
                words, but not in their true meaning. Jesus could thus teach without hindrance, 
                but, unfortunately for the unbelieving, they were hearing without obtaining any 
                blessing. In the original passage which Matthew quotes, Isaiah is apparently 
                commanded to harden the hearts of the people. If read superficially, it might 
                seem that God desired to harden their hearts. The true meaning is that God 
                commanded Isaiah to teach, even though the people, by hardening themselves 
                against his teaching, should be made worse rather than better by it. Thus, 
                though rebellious, Israel might not be blessed by Isaiah's teaching; they 
                might, by their example, waken a wholesome fear in their posterity, and cause 
                it to avoid like a sin.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and 
            your ears, for they hear. (<span class="comm">Jesus here addresses his disciples, who were a 
                cheering contrast to the unbelievers.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> For verily I say unto you, that 
            many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw 
            them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not. (<span class="comm">Our 
                Lord here gives us a glance into the very hearts of the prophets, and reveals 
                to us their desire to be witnesses of Messiah's ministry. But knowing they were 
                not to see their visions realized, they contented themselves with trying to 
                understand the full meaning of their visions, that they might anticipate the 
                days which were to come--<span class="style7">1 Peter 1: 10-12</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 13</span> And he saith unto 
            them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables? 
            (<span class="comm">This is a concession rather than a reproof. Parables could not be understood 
                without a key; but a few examples of parables explained would furnish such a 
                key.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 18</span> Hear then ye the parable of the sower.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 11</span> Now the parable is this: The seed is the 
            word of God.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 14</span> The 
            sower soweth the word.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And these {those}  by the way side, where the word 
            is sown;  are they that have heard;  
            and when they have heard,;  thenstraightway cometh Satan,  the devil, and 
            taketh away the word from their heart,  which hath been 
            sown in them.  that they may not believe and be 
            saved.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 19</span> When any one heareth the word 
            of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, 
            then cometh the evil one,
            and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is 
            he that was sown by the way side. (<span class="comm">The four soils are four hearts into 
                which truth is sown. The first heart, represented by the wayside, is one which 
                is too hardened for the Word to make any impression. It represents several 
                classes of people, as: 1. Those whose hearts have been made insensible by the 
                routine of meaningless rites and lifeless formalities. 2. Those who had 
                deadened their sensibilities by perversity and indifference. 3. Those whose 
                hearts were hardened by the constant march and countermarch of evil thoughts. 
                God's word lies on the surface of such hearts, and Satan can use any 
                insignificant or innocent passing thoughts as a bird to carry out of their 
                minds anything which they may have heard. The preacher's voice has scarcely 
                died away until some idle criticism of him or some careless bit of gossip about 
                a neighbor causes them to forget the sermon.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 16</span> And these {those}  in like 
            manner are they that are sown upon the rocky 
            places, {rock}  
            who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it {the word} with joy;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> and 
            they {these}  have no root in 
            themselves, but endure {who believe} for a while;
            then, when affliction or persecution ariseth because of 
            the word, straightway they stumble.  and in time of 
            temptation fall away.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 20</span> And he that was 
            sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway 
            with joy receiveth it;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> yet hath he not root in himself, but 
            endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because 


            of the word, straightway he stumbleth. (<span class="comm">This shallow, 
                rock-covered soil represents those who are deficient in tenacity of purpose. 
                Those who receive the word, but whose impulsive, shallow nature does not retain 
                it, and whose enthusiasm was as short-lived as it was vigorous. Any opposition, 
                slight or severe, makes them partial or total apostates. As sunlight 
                strengthens the healthy plant, but withers the sickly, ill-rooted one, so 
                tribulation establishes real faith, but destroys its counterfeit.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 18</span> And others are they that are sown {which fell} among the thorns, these are they that have heard,the word,  and as they go on their way
            the cares of the world, and the 
            deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the 
            word, and it becometh unfruitful.  they are choked with 
            cares and riches and pleasures of this
            life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 22</span> And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth 
            the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choked 
            the word, and he becometh unfruitful. (<span class="comm">This third class represents those 
                who begin well, but afterwards permit worldly cares to gain the mastery. These 
                to-day outnumber all other classes, and perhaps they have always been so.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 20</span> And those are they that were sown upon {<span class="style5">Luke 8: 15</span> And that in} the good ground; these are such as in an honest 
            and good heart, having heard {hear}  
            the word, hold it fast,  and accept it, and 
            bear  and bring forth fruit with patience.thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 13: 23</span> And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he 
            that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and 
            bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. (<span class="comm">Christianity 
                requires three things: a sower, good seed or a pure gospel, and an honest 
                hearer. All hearers are not equal in faithfulness. But we are not to take it 
                that the diversity is limited to the three rates or proportions specified. Of 
                the four hearts indicated, the first one hears, but heeds nothing; the second 
                one heeds, but is checked by 

                external influences; the third heeds, 
                but is choked by internal influences; the fourth heeds and holds fast until the 
                harvest. Gallio exemplifies the first (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 18: 17</span></span>). Peter and Mark for a time exemplified the second (<span class="comm"><span class="style7"></span>Mark 14: 66-72; Acts 12: 25; 13: 13; 15: 37-39</span>). The rich ruler and Demas represent the third (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 19: 22; 2 Timothy 4: 10</span></span>), as 
                does also Judas Iscariot. Cornelius and the Ber&aelig;ans (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 10: 33; 17: 11</span></span>) show us examples of the 
                fourth.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 21</span> And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to 
            be put under the bushel, or under a bed, and
            not to be put on the stand?  
            16 No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth 
            it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they which enter in may see the 
            light. (<span class="comm">A passage similar to this is found at <span class="style7">Matthew 5: 15</span>. See page 235.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> For 
            there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; {that shall not be made manifest;}  neither

            hath ears to hear, let him hear. (<span class="comm">This passage is often taken to indicate 
                the exposure of all things on the day of judgment. While all things shall be 
                revealed at the judgment, this passage does not refer to that fact. Jesus did 
                not come to put his light under a bushel; that is, to hide his teaching. All 
                inner instruction and private information was but temporary. Our Lord's design 
                was to reveal, not conceal. What was now concealed was only to keep back that 
                in the end it might be more fully known. Jesus covered his light as one might 
                shelter a candle with his hand until the flame has fully caught hold of the 
                wick.</span>)

                of this passage has been explained just

                warns us as to what we hear--things carnal or spiritual--and how we 
                hear them, whether carefully or carelessly. As we measure attention unto the 
                Lord, he measures back knowledge to us.</span>)</p>
