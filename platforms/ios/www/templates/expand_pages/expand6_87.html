        <h3>87. THE PRIVATE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">THROUGH SAMARIA. PROBABLY SEPTEMBER, A.D. 29.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 9: 51-56; JOHN 7: 10.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 7: 10</span> But when his brethren were gone up unto the feasts, 
            then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. (<span class="comm">This section 
                follows immediately after the preceding. The secrecy of this journey consists 
                in the fact that Jesus did not join the caravans or pilgrim bands, and that he 
                did not follow the usual Per&aelig;an route, but went directly through 
                Samaria.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 51</span> And it came to pass, when the days 
            were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face 
            to go to Jerusalem,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span> and sent messengers before his face: and 
            they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for 
            him. (<span class="comm">Taken in its strictest sense, the expression "taken up" 
                refers to our Lord's ascension, but it is here used to embrace his entire 
                passion. Though our Lord's death was still six months distant, his going to 
                Jerusalem is described as attended with a special effort, because from that 
                time forth Jerusalem was to occupy the position of headquarters, as Capernaum 
                had done, and his 

                withdrawals and returns would be with regard to 
                it. The presence of the twelve alone is sufficient to account for the 
                messengers. He did not wish to overtax the fickle hospitality of the Samaritans 
                by coming unannounced.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">53</span> And they did not receive him, because his face 
            was as though he were going to 
            Jerusalem. (<span class="comm">Had Jesus come among them on a missionary tour he would 
                doubtless have been received. But when he came as a Jew passing through to 
                Jerusalem, and using their highway as a convenience, they rejected him.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">54</span> And when his disciples James and John saw 
            this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down 
            from heaven, and consume them?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">55</span> But he turned, and rebuked 
            them,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">56</span> And they went to another village. (<span class="comm">Refusing to 
                receive a religious teacher was considered a rejection of his claim. This 
                rejection roused the ire of the two sons of thunder and prompted them to 
                suggest that the example of Elijah be followed (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Kings 1: 9-12</span></span>), but Jesus was a Saviour and not a 
                destroyer, so he passed on to another village. The conduct of John in after 
                years contrasts sharply with the wish which he here expressed--<span class="style7">Acts 8: 14-25</span>.</span>)
