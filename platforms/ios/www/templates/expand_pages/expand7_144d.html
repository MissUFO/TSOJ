        <h3>144D. THE CRUCIFIXION. JESUS FOUND TO BE DEAD</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 27: 57-66;  MARK 15: 42-47; <br>LUKE 23: 50-56;  JOHN 19: 31-42</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 31</span> The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, 
            that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (<span class="comm">for the day of 
                that sabbath was a high day </span>), 
            asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 
            (<span class="comm">According to rabbinical writing a few hours before the Sabbath were called the 
                Preparation; but afterwards the term was applied to the entire day preceding 
                the Sabbath. The Romans left the bodies of criminals hanging upon the cross 
                until beasts and birds of prey, or putrefaction, removed them. But the Jewish 


                law forbade that a body should hang over night; for a dead body 
                was accursed, and so the day following might be polluted by the curse which 
                attached to it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 21: 23; Joshua 8: 29; 10: 26; </span>Jos. Wars 4: 5. 2</span>). The context suggests that the Jews had grown lax with regard to this law on account of the trouble of obtaining the consent from the Romans required to carry it out. But as the Sabbath in this instance was that of the passover week, and as they were ready enough to do anything to show that Jesus was an extraordinary criminal, they asked Pilate that their law might be observed. Instead of killing the criminals, they broke their legs, which rendered recovery impossible, since putrefaction almost immediately set it.</span>)</p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of 
            the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> but 
            when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his 
            legs:</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his 
            side (<span class="comm">to insure death in case they might be mistaken</span>), and 
            straightway there came out blood and water. 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> And he that hath 
            seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith 
            true, that ye also may believe. (<span class="comm">Many able men have argued learnedly that 
                this flow of blood and water was evidence that Jesus died of a ruptured, or 
                literally broken, heart; but they confess themselves involved in difficulties, 
                for it is hard to reconcile the idea that Jesus died a voluntary death with the 
                idea that he died of any natural cause whatever. Can anything be at once 
                natural and supernatural? However, John's asservation that he was an 
                eye-witness of this shows that he attached importance to it. To him the body of 
                Jesus gave evidence that it differed from other dead bodies. We enter with 
                hesitancy the realm of symbolism, knowing how flagrantly it is abused, but we 
                offer this as a suggestion. Jesus died for our sins, and his death was 
                therefore to provide a means for the cleansing of sin. But, under the terms of 
                his gospel, sins are visibly and physically washed away by water, and invisibly 
                and spiritually by blood (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 10: 22</span></span>). 
                Now, since both these means were seen 

                by a faithful witness to 
                issue from the side of our crucified Lord, contrary to the ordinary law and 
                course of nature, we have additional reason to believe that things out of the 
                course of nature, namely, the cleansing of sin, etc., were accomplished by his 
                crucifixion.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be 
            fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalms 34: 20</span></span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And again another scripture saith, They shall 
            look on him whom they pierced. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Zechariah 12: 10</span>. Even after his death divine power went on fulfilling the 
                prophecies concerning Jesus. He hangs upon the cross as one of a group of 
                three, yet, in the twinkling of an eye, he is separated from the other two by 
                the fulfillment of a brace of prophecies which point him out as the chosen of 
                God.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> And after these things  when even was now 
            come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
            behold, 
            there came a rich man from Arimathaea,  
            a city of the Jews,  named Joseph,  
            of Arimathaea,  who was a councillor,of honorable estate,  a good and 
            righteous man </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 51</span> (<span class="comm">he had not consented to their counsel and 
                deed</span>),  who also himself was looking for the kingdom of 
            God;  who also himself was Jesus' disciple: {
            being a disciple of Jesus,} but secretly for fear of the 
            Jews (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 12: 42, 43</span></span>), 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 58</span> this man  boldly went in 
            unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.  asked of 
            Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus (<span class="comm">Joseph's town has been 
                variously identified with Ramleh in Dan, Ramathaim in Ephraim (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 2: 18</span></span>). It was a fulfillment of prophecy 
                that the one who buried Jesus should be rich (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 53: 9</span></span>). It is strange that those who were not afraid to be 
                disciples were afraid to ask for our Lord's body, yet he who was afraid to be a 
                disciple feared not to do this thing</span>):</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 44</span> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead (<span class="comm">instances are cited where men 
                lived one whole week upon the cross, and men rarely died the first day</span>): 
            and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any 
            while 

            dead. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> And when he learned it of the 
            centurion,  Then Pilate  
            granted the corpse to Joseph.  commanded it to be given 
            up.  and Pilate gave 
            him leave. He came therefore, and took away his body. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 39</span> And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by 
            night (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 3: 2</span></span>), 
            bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. (<span class="comm">Myrrh was a 
                resin and the aloe was pulverized wood. Both were aromatic <span class="style7">Psalms 45: 8</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 59</span> And 
            Joseph  bought a linen cloth (<span class="comm">a sindon--see p. 
                693</span>), </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 53</span> And he took  
            the body,  down,  and taking 
            him down, wound him in the linen cloth, {and wrapped 
            it in a clean linen cloth,}</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 40</span> So they 
            took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the 
            custom of the Jews is to bury. (<span class="comm">As to the swathing of dead bodies, see p. 
                526, also <span class="style7">Acts 5: 6</span>. The spices were 
                wrapped between the folds of the linen in order to partially embalm the body. 
                Thus two members of the Sanhedrin unite to bury Jesus, each showing his 
                reverence in his own way: Joseph by buying a sindon instead of cheaper cloth, 
                and Nicodemus by a wonderful wealth of spices--twelve hundred ounces. 
                Possibly the heart of Nicodemus smote him for his tardiness in honoring Christ, 
                and he desired to appease his conscience by giving the Lord a royal 
                burial <span class="style7">2 Chronicles 16: 14</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden (<span class="comm">belonging to 
                Joseph</span>); and in the garden a {his own} new 
            tomb which he had {that was  
            which had been}  hewn in stone,  
            out of a {the} rock:  
            wherein was never man yet laid. {where never man had 
            yet lain.} (<span class="comm">To the sindon Joseph adds the honor of a burial in his own 
                tomb. The unused state of the tomb is mentioned to show that there is no shadow 
                of doubt as to whose resurrection opened it.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 54</span> And it was the day of the 
            Preparation, and the sabbath drew on. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 42</span> There then because of the Jews' Preparation (<span class="comm">for the tomb was nigh at hand</span>) 
            they laid Jesus.  and he rolled a great stone to {
            against} the door of the tomb.  
            and departed. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 55</span> And the 

            women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and 
            beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 61</span> And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary,
            the mother of 
            Joses  sitting over against the sepulchre.  and beheld the tomb,  where  and how his body was laid. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 56</span> And they returned, and 
            prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the 
            commandment. (<span class="comm">As Jesus died about three o'clock in the afternoon, and as 
                all work had to stop at sunset, which was the beginning of the Sabbath, Joseph 
                was much hurried in his efforts to bury Jesus. The context, therefore, shows 
                that our Lord was not completely embalmed by him. The body of Jesus might have 
                been kept elsewhere until after the Sabbath; but because the tomb was near it 
                appears to have been used temporarily, and the preparation of spices by the 
                women shows that even that part of the burial was not, in their estimation, 
                completed. This unfinished burial led the women back to the tomb early on the 
                first day of the week, and thus brought to the disciples the glad news of the 
                resurrection without any needless delay.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 62</span> Now 
            on the morrow, which is the day 
            after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered 
            together unto Pilate (<span class="comm">This was not the whole Sanhedrin, but members of it. 
                When did they come to Pilate? Meyer, Cook, etc., say that the Greek word 
                translated "morrow" precludes any other idea than it was after 
                daylight Saturday morning, but Michaelis, Paulus, Kuinoel, etc., say that they 
                came Friday night, and we think their view is correct. The word translated 
                "morrow" also means "the next day." As the Jewish day 
                began at sunset, we know of no other Greek adverb by which Matthew could have 
                expressed the beginning of a day. Had it been the Sabbath morning there is no 
                reason why Matthew should not have said so. By mentioning, instead, the 
                Preparation, he draws the mind back to what we would call Friday night. It is 
                highly improbable that the Jews would leave the tomb of Jesus unguarded for one 
                whole night. Their gathering thus to Pilate in the shades of evening presents a 
                gruesome picture</span>),</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">63</span> saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise 
            again. (<span class="comm">For this saying, <span class="style7"> Matthew 12: 39, 40</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">64</span> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until 
            the third day (<span class="comm">Had the phrase "after three days" meant three 
                full days to them, they would have said "until the fourth day." For 
                the Jewish method of counting days see p. 306</span>), lest haply his 
            disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from 
            the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first. (<span class="comm">The marvelous 
                signs accompanying the death of Jesus appealed to men's fear rather than to 
                their love, and were, therefore, calculated to make a far deeper impression 
                upon his enemies than upon his friends. We find, therefore, these Jewish rulers 
                full of active interest in the dead Christ while his apostles and friends are 
                listless in despair. They, of course, did not think it possible that Jesus 
                could indeed rise, but, seeing the profound impression which the portents 
                attending the crucifixion had made upon the multitude (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 48</span></span>), and judging the disciples of Jesus by 
                themselves--full of all subtlety and cunning--they grasped at once 
                the idea that the disciples could make a great stir among the people by 
                stealing the body and proclaiming the predicted resurrection. The apostles, on 
                the other hand, when the actual resurrection had taken place, did not learn for 
                fifty days what use to make of it, thus showing they could not have planned a 
                pretended resurrection.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">65</span> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard (<span class="comm">The 
                Greek here may be the indicative or the imperative; it is clearly the latter. 
                If the Jews had possessed a guard, they would not have asked for one. Pilate 
                consents to their request by saying, "Have ye a guard:" thereby 
                fully sanctioning their idea</span>): go, make it as sure as ye can. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">66</span> So they 
            went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with 
            them. (<span class="comm">They sealed the stone by drawing a string or tape across it and 
                fastening the ends with wax or clay to the surface of the rock on either side. 
                If either seals were broken, that fact would show that the tomb was entered 
                from without.</span>)</p>
