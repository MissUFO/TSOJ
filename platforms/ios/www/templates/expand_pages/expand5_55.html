        <h3>55. JESUS RAISES THE WIDOW'S SON.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT NAIN IN GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 7: 11-17.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span>  And it came to pass soon afterwards 
            (<span class="comm">many ancient authorities read on the next day</span>), that he went into a 
            city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude. 
            (<span class="comm">We find that Jesus had been thronged with multitudes pretty continuously since 
                the choosing of his twelve apostles. Nain lies on the northern slope of the 
                mountain, which the Crusaders called Little Hermon, between twenty and 
                twenty-five miles south of Capernaum, and about two miles west of Endor. At 
                present it is a small place with about a dozen mud hovels, but still bears its 
                old name, which the Arabs have modified into Nein. It is situated on a bench in 
                the mountain about sixty feet above the plain.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. (<span class="comm">Places of sepulture were outside the towns, that ceremonial pollution must be avoided. To this rule there was an exception. The kings of Judah were buried in the city of David (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Kings 16: 20; 21: 18, 26</span></span>). The Jews were careful to give public expression to their sympathy for those who were bereaved (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 11: 19</span></span>). The death of an only child represented to them as to us the extreme of sorrow (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 6: 26; Zecheriah 12: 10; Amos 8: 10</span></span>). But in this case the sorrow was heightened by the 
                fact that the mother was a widow, and hence evidently dependent upon her son 
                for support. Her son had comforted her in her first loss of a husband, but now 
                that her son was dead, there was none left to comfort.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> And when the Lord saw her (<span class="comm">Some take this use of the phrase &quot;the Lord,&quot; as an evidence of the late date at which Luke wrote his Gospel; but the point is not well taken, for John used it even before Jesus ascension--<span class="style7">John 21: 7</span></span>), 
            he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. (<span class="comm">As the funeral 
                procession came out of the gate, they met Jesus with his company coming in. 
                Hence there were many witnesses to what followed. But the miracle in this 
                instance was not wrought so much attest our Lord's commission, or to show his 
                power, as to do good. As Jesus had no other business in Nain but to do good, we 
                may well believe that he went there for the express purpose of comforting this 
                forlorn mother. Compare 
                <span class="style7">John 11: 1-15</span>. Good blessings may come to us when reason speaks and 
                God's wise judgment answers; but we get our best blessings when our afflictions 
                cry unto him and his compassion replies.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. (<span class="comm">The word here translated &quot;bier&quot; may mean a bier or coffin, and the authorities are about equally divided as to which it was. It was more likely a stretcher of boards, with the pallet or bed upon it, and the body of the young man wrapped in linen lying upon the bed. Coffins, which were common in Babylon and Egypt, were rarely used by the Jews, save in the burial of people of distinction; and, if we may trust the writing of the later rabbis, the burial of children. When they were used, the body was placed in them, and borne without any lid to the place of sepulture. We find no coffin in the burial of either Lazarus or Jesus. Jesus was, no doubt, known to many in Nain, and it is no wonder that those who bore the bier stood still when he touched it. Though we can not say that he had raised the dead prior to this, we can say that he had healed every kind of disease known among the people, and therefore his act would beget a reasonable expectancy that he might do something even here.</span>) And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. (<span class="comm">Here, as in the other instances where Jesus revived the dead, we find that he issues a personal call to the party whose remains are before him. It suggests the sublime thought that he has as full dominion and authority over the unseen as over the seen; and that should he issue a general call, all the dead would revive again as obediently and immediately as did the single one to whom he now spoke (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 28, 29</span></span>). The command of Jesus, moreover, is spoken with the ease and consciousness of authority known only to Divinity. Compare the dependent tone of Simon Peter--<span class="style7">Acts 3: 6</span>.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>  And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. (<span class="comm">Thus 
                showing that not only life, but also health and strength, were restored.</span>) 
            And he gave him to his mother. (<span class="comm">As the full fruitage of his compassion. The 
                scene suggests that Christ will, with his own hands, restore kindred to kindred 
                in the glorious morning of resurrection.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span>  And fear took hold on all 
            (<span class="comm">Because the power of God had been so signally manifested among them. They 
                recognized the presence of God's power and mercy, yet by no means apprehended 
                the nearness of his very person</span>): and they glorified God, saying, A 
            great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people. 
            (<span class="comm">Expectation of the return of one of the prophets was at that time widely 
                spread. See 
                <span class="style7">Luke 9: 8, 19</span>. That they 
                should esteem Jesus as no more than a prophet was no wonder, for as yet even 
                his apostles had not confessed him as the Christ. In state and conduct Jesus 
                appeared to them too humble to fulfill the popular ideas of Messiahship. But in 
                wisdom and miracle he outshone all God's former messengers. The 
                "visiting" of God refers to the long absence of the more strikingly 
                miraculous powers of God as exercised through the prophets. None had raised the 
                dead since the days of Elisha.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span>  And this report went forth concerning him 
            in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about. (<span class="comm">This great miracle 
                caused the fame of Jesus to fill all Jud&aelig;a as well as Galilee. It seems, 
                from what next follows, to have reached John the Baptist in his prison on the 
                east of the Dead Sea.</span>)
