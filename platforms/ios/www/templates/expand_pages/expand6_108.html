        <h3>108. PARABLE OF THE PHARISEE AND PUBLICAN.</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 18: 9-14.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And he spake also this parable unto certain who 
            trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought
            It is (<span class="comm">commonly said that this parable teaches humility in prayer, but the 
                preface and conclusion (<span class="comm">see <span class="style7">Luke 18: 14</span></span>) 
                show that it is indeed to set forth generally the difference between 
                self-righteousness and humility, and that an occasion of prayer is chosen 
                because it best illustrates the point which the Lord desired to teach. The 
                parable shows that the righteousness in which these parties trusted was devoid 
                of that true charity or heart-love toward God and man without which our 
                characters are worthless in the sight of God--<span class="style7">Proverbs 30: 12, 13; Isaiah 65: 5; 1 Corinthians 13: 1-3</span></span>): 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> Two men went up into the temple to pray (<span class="comm">The temple was the appointed 
                place for Jewish prayer. To it the Jew went if near at hand, and towards it he 
                prayed it afar off. The stated hours of prayer were 9 A. M. and 3 P. M., but 
                men went there to pray whenever they felt like it</span>); the one a 
            Pharisee, and the other a publican. (<span class="comm">The two represent the extremes of 
                Jewish social and religious life--see p. 71 and 76.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> The Pharisee 
            stood and prayed thus with himself (<span class="comm">This may mean that he stood alone, 
                withdrawing from the contamination of others, but it seems rather to mean that 
                he prayed having himself, rather than God, uppermost in his thoughts</span>), 
            God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, 
            adulterers, or even as this publican. (<span class="comm">His prayer is more a boast as to 
                himself than an expression of worship toward God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 3: 17, 18</span></span>), and he makes the sinful record of the publican a 
                dark background on which to display the bright contrast of his own 
                character--a character for which he was thankful, and apparently with 
                reason.</span>)


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> I fast twice in the week (<span class="comm">the law appointed one fast in the 
                year, 

                viz.: on the Day of Atonement (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 16: 29, 30</span></span>), but the Pharisees fasted on Mondays and Thursdays 
                of each week</span>); I give tithes of all that I get. (<span class="comm">I give the tenth 
                part of my income. The law required that tithes be given from the corn, wine, 
                oil, and cattle (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 14: 22, 23</span></span>), 
                but the Pharisees took account of the humblest herbs of the garden, and gave a 
                tenth of their mint, anise, and cummin (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 23: 23</span></span>). Thus he confessed his virtues rather than his sins.</span>) 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> But the publican, standing afar off (<span class="comm">remote from the Holy Place</span>), 
            would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 123: 1, 2; 40: 12; Ezra 9: 6</span></span>), but smote his 
            breast (<span class="comm">as if to remind himself of the stroke of God which he so richly 
                deserved--<span class="style7">Nahum 2: 7; Luke 23: 48</span></span>), saying, God be thou merciful to me a sinner. (<span class="comm">He makes full 
                confession of his sin without excuse or justification, and without offset of 
                righteousness. Moreover, he petitions for no temporal blessings, but simply 
                asks for mercy--<span class="style7">1 Timothy 1: 15</span>.</span>) 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the 
            other (<span class="comm">we are taught here, as in the parable of the prodigal son, that the 
                penitent unrighteous are more acceptable to God than the righteous who make no 
                confession of their sins</span>): for every one that exalteth himself shall 
            be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 14: 11</span>, 
                see p. 494. The Pharisee was an example of the first, and the publican of the 
                second.</span>)
