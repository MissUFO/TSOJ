        <h3>36. THE CALL OF MATTHEW.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT OR NEAR CAPERNAUM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATT. 9: 9;  MARK 2: 13-14;  LUKE 5: 27-28.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 5:27</span> And after these thingsa (<span class="comm">after the healing of 
                the paralytic</span>) he went forth,  again by the 
            seaside (<span class="comm">i. e., he left Capernaum, and sought the shore of the sea, 
                which formed a convenient auditorium for him, and which was hence a favorite 
                scene for his teaching</span>); and all the multitude resorted unto him, and 
            he taught them.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 2:14</span> And as he  Jesus passed 
            by from thence, he saw  and beheld  
            a man,  a publican, named {
            called} Matthew,  Levi,  
            the son of Alphaeus (<span class="comm">It will 
                be observed that Matthew, in his account of his call, does not make himself 
                prominent. All 

                the evangelists keep themselves in the background. 
                Because Mark and Luke give us the name Levi, it has been thought by some that 
                they describe the call of a different person from the one mentioned by 
                Matthew--an opinion which seems to have started with Origen. But the 
                difference in name is not an important divergence, for many in that day had two 
                names; as, for example, Lebb&aelig;us, who was called Thadd&aelig;us; Silas, 
                who was called Sylvanus; John, who was called Mark; etc. Moreover, it was then 
                common to change the name; as is shown by the cases of Simon, who became Peter; 
                Joseph, who became Barnabas; Saul, who became Paul, etc. Therefore, as we have 
                previously suggested (<span class="comm">p. 111</span>), that Nathanael was also known as Bartholomew, so 
                here we are satisfied that Levi is called Matthew; for the narratives which 
                describe the calls are almost verbatim, and they agree chronologically, being 
                placed by all three Evangelists between the healing of the paralytic and the 
                feast where Jesus ate with publicans. Mark involves us in another difficulty by 
                calling Levi the son of Alph&aelig;us; for a man named Alph&aelig;us was the 
                father of James the younger (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10: 3</span></span>). It is not likely, however, that Matthew and James were brothers, for 
                Alph&aelig;us was a very common Jewish name, and brothers are usually mentioned 
                in pairs in the apostolic lists, and these two are not so mentioned. Pool takes 
                the extreme view here, contending that James, Matthew, Thadd&aelig;us, and 
                Simon Zelotes were four brethren</span>), sitting at the place of toll 
            (<span class="comm">Wherever it is at all practicable, Orientals sit at their work. The place of 
                toil was usually a booth or a small hut. Whether Matthew's booth was by the 
                lake, to collect duties on goods and people ferried across; or whether it was 
                by the roadside on the great highway leading from Damascus to Acco, to collect 
                taxes on all produce brought into Capernaum, is not material. The revenues 
                which Rome derived from conquered nations consisted of tolls, tithes, harbor 
                duties, taxes for use of public pasture lands, and duties for the use of mines 
                and salt works</span>), and he saith {said} unto 
            him, Follow me.

        <p align="left" class="style4">
            <span class="style5">Luke 5:28</span> And he forsook all, And he arose {rose up} and followed 

            him. (<span class="comm">Such 
                obedience was not, of course, performed in ignorance; it indicates that Matthew 
                was already a disciple, as were the four fisherman when they also received a 
                like call. Matthew was now called to become a personal attendant of Jesus, 
                preparatory to being chosen an apostle. Nor are we to conclude from the 
                abruptness of his movements that he went off without settling accounts with the 
                head of his office. Though it may be more dramatic to thus picture him as 
                departing at once, yet the settlement of accounts was indispensable to his good 
                name in the future, and in no way diminishes the reality and beauty of his 
                sacrifice--a beauty which Matthew himself forbears to mention, as became 
                him (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Proverbs 27: 2</span></span>). But Matthew 
                certainly neither delayed nor sought counsel (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galatians 1: 15-16</span></span>). By thus calling a publican, Jesus reproved the religious 
                narrowness of his times.</span>)
