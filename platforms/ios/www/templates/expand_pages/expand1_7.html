        <h3>7. THE BIRTH OF JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(AT BETHLEHEM OF JUDEA, B.C. 5.)</h3>
        <h3>Luke 2: 1-7.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span>  Now it came to pass in those days (<span class="comm">the days of 
                the birth of John the Baptist</span>), there went out a decree (<span class="comm">a law</span>) 
            from C&aelig;sar Augustus (<span class="comm">Octavius, or Augustus, C&aelig;sar was the 
                nephew of and successor to Julius C&aelig;sar. He took the name Augustus in 
                compliment to his own greatness; and our month August is named for him; its old 
                name being Sextilis</span>), that all the world should be enrolled. 
            (<span class="comm">This enrollment or census was the first step in the process of taxation.</span>) 
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> This was the first enrolment. (<span class="comm">Publius Sulpicius Quirinius was governor of Syria, A.D. 6-11, and made a census of his province at that time, as Luke well knew (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 5: 37</span></span>). We have no other record showing either his governorship or a census made by him at the time of the birth of Christ. But he was held in high favor by the Emperor, and was, about the time of the birth of Christ, carrying on a war just north of Syria, in Cilicia, and it is therefore easy for us to accept Luke's statement that as imperial commissioner or as governor of Syria he made such a census.</span>) made when Quirinius was governor (<span class="comm">Quirinius was doubtless twice governor of Syria, his first term being about B.C. 5-1. The Greek word hegemon, which Luke uses for governor, would be used for either of the Roman titles, viz.: Propr&aelig;tor, or senatorial governor; or Qu&aelig;stor, or imperial commissioner. Quirinius may have commenced the enrollment as Qu&aelig;stor and finished it ten years later as Propr&aelig;tor. He was well-known character in that age. Harsh and avaricious as a governor, but an able and loyal soldier, earning a Roman triumph for successes in Cilicia, and being honored by a public funeral in A.D. 21</span>) of Syria. (<span class="comm">A Roman province including all Palestine, and a tract four or five times as large lying to the northeast of Palestine.</span>)</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span>  And all went to enroll themselves
            (<span class="comm">The enrollment may have had no reference to taxation. It was more probably to 
                ascertain the military strength of the various provinces. The Romans enrolled 
                each person at the place where he was then residing; but permitted the Jews to 
                thus return to their ancestral or tribal cities and enroll themselves as 
                citizens of these cities</span>), every one to his own city. (<span class="comm">The city 
                where his ancestors had been settled by Joshua when he divided the 
                land--<span class="style7">Joshua 13-18</span></span>)</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out 
            of the city of Nazareth (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">see Luke 1: 26</span></span>), unto Jud&aelig;a, to the 
            city of David (<span class="comm">after the lapse of ten centuries the name of David still 
                cast its fragrance over the place of his birth--<span class="style7">1 Samuel 17: 12</span></span>), which is called Bethlehem (<span class="comm">Meaning &quot;house of bread.&quot; It was the later or Jewish name for the old Canaanitish village of Ephrath, the Ephrath near which Rachel died (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 35: 19</span></span>). It was marked by 
                Micah as the birthplace of Messiah--<span class="style7">Micah 5: 2; Matthew 2: 5-6</span></span>), because he was of the house and family of 
            David; 
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> to be taxed with Mary, who was betrothed to him (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">see Matthew 1: 25</span></span>), being great with 
            child. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered. (<span class="comm">The early Christians made no record of the date of Christ's birth; we find no mention of December 25 earlier than the fourth century. The Eastern church celebrated Christ's birth by a feast called Epiphany, which means manifestation. They chose January 6 as the date for this feast, for they reasoned that if the first Adam was born on the sixth day of creation, the second Adam must have been born on the sixth day of the year. The Western church celebrated Christ's birth on the 25th of December by a feast called Natalis, which means Nativity. But Pope Julius 1: (<span class="comm">A.D. 337-352</span>) designated December 25 as the proper day, and the Eastern churches soon united with the Western churches in observing this day; and the custom has become universal. We do not observe this day because of the Pope's decree, but because of the tradition on which the Pope's decree was founded.</span>)</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And she brought forth 
            her firstborn (<span class="comm">This word in no way implies that the Virgin subsequently had 
                other children. Jesus, the only begotten, is also called the 
                firstborn--<span class="style7">Hebrews 1: 6</span></span>) son; and 
            she wrapped (<span class="comm">having none to help her, she swathed him in bands with her own 
                hands</span>) him in swaddling clothes (<span class="comm">the new-born Jewish child was washed in 
                water, rubbed with salt, and then wrapped in bands or blankets, which confined 
                the limbs closely--<span class="style7">Ezekiel 16: 4</span></span>), and laid him in a manger (<span class="comm">Justin Martyr, who born about the beginning of the second century and suffered martyrdom A.D. 165, first tells us the tradition that the stable in which Jesus was born was a cavern. Caves, however, were never used for stables except when opened on the sides of hills. The one at Bethlehem is a cellar fourteen feet under the level surface. Justin must, therefore, be mistaken</span>), because there was no room for them in the inn. (<span class="comm">Eastern inns had landlords like our own. The inn was full at this time because of the number who had come to be enrolled. Inns contained rooms for persons and stalls for animals: there was no room in the former, but there was in the latter.</span>)
