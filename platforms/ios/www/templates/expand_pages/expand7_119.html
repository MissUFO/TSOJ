        <h3>119A. THIRD GROUP OF PARABLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE. <br>TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 21: 23-27;  <br>MARK 11: 27-33;  LUKE 20: 1-8.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 1</span>   And it came to pass, on one of the days,they (<span class="comm">Jesus and the disciples</span>) come again to Jerusalem:

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 23</span>   And when he was come into the temple,
            and as he was walking in the temple (<span class="comm">The large outer 
                court of the temple, known as the court of the Gentiles, was thronged during 
                the feasts, and was no doubt the part selected by Jesus and his apostles when 
                they taught or preached in the temple. We thrice find them on that side of it 
                where Solomon's porch was located--<span class="style7">John 10: 23; Acts 3: 11; 5: 23</span></span>),  as he was 
            teaching the people and preaching the gospel (<span class="comm">viz.: "the time is 
                fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye"--<span class="style7">Mark 1: 15</span></span>), there came upon him {
            come  unto him}  
            the chief priests and the scribes, and {with} 
            the elders; {of the people} (<span class="comm">the Sanhedrin (<span class="comm">see 
                    p. 415</span>). This committee of that august tribunal came in formal state and with a 
                great show of authority, hoping to make it apparent to the people that Jesus 
                was an unauthorized, self-appointed meddler in matters over which they had 
                exclusive control.</span>)   



        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 2</span>   and they spake,
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 28</span>  and they said {saying} unto him Tell 
            us: By what authority doest thou these things?  and 
            {or} who is he that gave thee this authority?
            to do these things? (<span class="comm">To regulate and control the affairs 
                of the temple belonged unquestionably and exclusively to the priests and 
                Levites. Knowing that Jesus had no authority from 

                any priest or 
                any scribe, they boldly challenged his right to cleanse the temple or to teach 
                in it, feeling sure that to defend himself he would be forced to publicly 
                declare himself as the Messiah and thus to give them the matter for accusation 
                which they had long sought--<span class="style7">John 10: 24.</span></span>)  


        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 24</span>   And Jesus answered and said 
            unto them,  I also will ask you a {
            one} question, which if ye tell me,  and answer 
            me,  I likewise will tell you by what authority I do 
            these things. </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span>   The baptism of John, 
            whence was it?  Was it from heaven, or from men? answer 
            me. (<span class="comm">The question which Jesus asked was intimately and inseparably 
                connected with the question which they had asked. Jesus, of course, did not 
                derive his authority from John the Baptist, but John had testified plainly to 
                the Messiahship of Jesus, and had, in no uncertain terms, designated Jesus as 
                immeasurably greater than himself. Now, if the Pharisees admitted that John was 
                a heaven-sent messenger or witness (<span class="comm">of which fact his baptism was propounded as 
                    a test, since it was a religious ordinance introduced on his authority</span>), then 
                John had already answered the Sanhedrin that Jesus derived his authority from 
                his Messiahship, and hence, all that the Sanhedrin had to do to satisfy their 
                minds was simply to believe John. But if, on the other hand, the 
                Pharisees rejected John's pretensions and claims as a heaven-sent messenger in 
                the face of the almost universal popular conviction, then what was there for 
                Jesus to present his claims to so blind, bigoted, and unreasoning a body?</span>) 


        </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 31</span>  And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he 
            will say,  unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?
            (<span class="comm">When he testified to the Messiahship of Jesus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 7, 15, 34; 3: 26-36; 10: 40-42</span></span>). The Sanhedrin 
                could not admit that the messenger was heaven-sent and yet deny his testimony.</span>) 


        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 21: 26</span>    But if we shall {should we} say, From 
            men--  all the people will stone us:we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.  for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.  
            they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 11: 33</span>  And they answered 

            Jesus  that they knew not whence it was.   and said, 
            {say,} We know not. (<span class="comm">It should be noted in their 
                consultation there was no effort either to ascertain or to speak the truth. The 
                question as to whether John really was or was not a prophet was in no sense the 
                subject of their investigation. They were merely deciding what to say. They 
                were seeking for the most expedient answer, and as neither truthful answer was 
                expedient, they resolved to falsely deny any knowledge of the case. Men of such 
                brazen dishonesty could not be dealt with openly and fairly as could sincere 
                seekers after truth.</span>) And Jesus,  also said {saith} unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do 
            these things. (<span class="comm">Their spoken lie was, "We know not," but their 
                inward and true answer was, "We will not tell," and Jesus answered 
                the suppressed truth saying, "Neither tell I." How readily the 
                subtle minds of the Jewish people would justify Jesus in thus declining to 
                submit the question of his authority to judges who at that very moment publicly 
                confessed their inability to even hazard an opinion, much less render a 
                decision, as to the authority of John the Baptist, who claims were in popular 
                estimation so obvious. It was plain that however well these men might judge 
                human credentials, the divine testimonials of a prophet or of the Messiah were 
                above their carnal sphere. Thus Jesus put his enemies to confusion in the first 
                of man conflicts of that perilous Tuesday. But we may well imagine that they 
                were rendered more bitter by the evidence of a wisdom so much beyond any which 
                they possessed.</span>)
