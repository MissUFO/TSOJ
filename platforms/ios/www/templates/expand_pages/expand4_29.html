        <h3>29. JESUS' TEMPORARY RESIDENCE.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 4: 13-16.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span>    And leaving Nazareth (<span class="comm">This expression means 
                that Jesus now ceased to make Nazareth his home. For description of Nazareth, 
                see page 60</span>), he came and dwelt in Capernaum (<span class="comm">See page 119. 
                Capernaum means city of Nahum, or village of consolation. Its modern name, 
                "Tel-Hum," means hill of Nahum. The word "dwelt" means 
                that Jesus made this town his headquarters. He owned no house there (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 8: 20</span></span>). He may have dwelt with some of his disciples--for instance, Simon Peter--<span class="style7">Matthew 8: 14-16</span></span>), which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali (<span class="comm">Capernaum was in Naphtali, and the border of the tribe of Zebulun was three or four miles south of it. This part of the country was densely populated, and had in it many choice spirits such as Jesus chose for his apostles</span>):  </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span>    that it might be fulfilled which 
            was spoken through Isaiah the prophet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 8: 21, 22; 9: 1, 2</span></span>), saying,</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>    The 
            land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, 
            Galilee of the Gentiles. (<span class="comm">This land or region was the first to suffer in 
                the beginning of those wars which finally resulted in the captivity of the ten 
                tribes. The people of this district were smitten by Benhadad (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 15: 20</span></span>), and afterwards by Tiglath-pileser (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Kings 15: 29; 1 Chronicles 5: 26</span></span>), some time before the general captivity of the ten tribes (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Kings 17: 6</span></span>). It is called Galilee of the Gentiles, because it was, according to Strabo and others, inhabited by Egyptians, Arabians, and Phoenicians, as well as by Hebrews.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span>   The people that 

            sat in darkness saw great light, And to 
            them that sat in the region and shadow of death, To them did light spring 
            up. (<span class="comm">Those who by reason of their ignorance and depravity suffered the 
                torments of war, and sat as it were under the shadow of the wing of death, were 
                designated by prophecies as the class among whom the light of the gospel would 
                spring up in the fullness and richness of its blessing. Jesus, the "Light 
                of the world," fulfilled this prophecy, and apart from him there can be 
                no pretense of its fulfillment. Galilee had its prophets, but the enemies of 
                Jesus themselves bear witness that none of them were great enough 
                "lights" to fulfill this prophecy--<span class="style7">John 7: 52.</span></span>)</p>
