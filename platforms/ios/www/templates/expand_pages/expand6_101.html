        <h3>101. SABBATH HEALING.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY PER&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 14: 1-24.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> And it came to pass, when he went into the house of 
            one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were 
            watching him. (<span class="comm">The Pharisees were an unorganized party, hence their rulers 
                were such not by office, but by influence. Those who were members of the 
                Sanhedrin, or who were distinguished among the rabbis, might fitly be spoken of 
                as rulers among them. The context favors the idea that Jesus was invited for 
                the purpose of being watched--a carrying out of the Pharisaic purpose 
                declared at <span class="style7">Luke 11: 53, 54</span>. Bountiful 
                feasts on the Sabbath day were common among the Jews; the food, however, was 
                cooked the previous day in obedience to the precept at <span class="style7">Exodus 16: 23</span></span>).</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And behold, there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy. (<span class="comm">The phrase "let him go" of  <span class="style7">Luke 14: 4</span> shows that the man was not a guest, but rather one who seems to have taken advantage of the freedom of an 
                Oriental house to stand among the lookers-on. He may have been there purely 
                from his own choice, but the evil intention with which Jesus was invited makes 
                it highly probable that the man's presence was no accident, but part of a 
                deep-laid plot to entrap Jesus.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And Jesus answering (<span class="comm">replying to their unspoken thoughts, in which they were assuming that he would heal the sick man</span>) spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not? </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> And they held their peace. (<span class="comm">They 
                evidently expected Jesus to act on the impulse, and were confused by his calm, 
                deliberate question. If they declared it lawful, they defeated their plot, and 
                if they said otherwise, they involved themselves in an argument with him in 
                which, as experience taught them, they would be humiliated before the people. 
                Hence, they kept silence, but their silence only justified him, since it was 
                the duty of every lawyer to pronounce this act unlawful if it had been so.</span>)
            And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.  </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And he said 
            unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will 
            not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day?</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And they could not answer again unto these things. (<span class="comm">Here Jesus again asserts that the Sabbath law did not forbid acts of mercy. See pp. 212, 213, 215. Though silenced, the Pharisees relented not, either as to their bigotry or their hatred.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And 
            he spoke a parable unto those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose 
            out the chief seats (<span class="comm">The triclinia, or Grecian table, then in use 
                had three sections which were placed together so as to form a flat-bottomed 
                letter U. The space enclosed by the table was not occupied. It was left vacant 
                that the servants might enter it and attend to the wants of the guests who 
                reclined around the outer margin of the table. The central seat of each of 
                these three sections were deemed a place of honor. This struggle for precedence 
                was a small ambition, but many of the ambitions of our day are equally small</span>);
            saying unto them, </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> When thou art bidden of 
            any man to a marriage feast (<span class="comm">Jesus mentions another kind of feast than the 
                one in progress, that he may not be needlessly personal</span>), sit not 
            down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Philippians 2: 3</span></span>) than thou be bidden of him,
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this 
            man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place. 
            (<span class="comm">Because when ousted from the top he would find every place full except the 
                bottom.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; 
            that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up 
            higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with 
            thee. (<span class="comm">The words here used by our Lord teach how to avoid earthly shame and 
                to obtain worldly honor. But they form a parable which is intended to teach the 
                great spiritual truth that true humility leads to exaltation.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> For 
            everyone that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself 
            shall be exalted. (<span class="comm">This is one of our Lord's favorite maxims (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 18: 14; Matthew 23: 12</span></span>). Both man and 
                God look upon humiliation as the just punishment of pride; but it is a pleasure 
                to every right-minded spirit to give joy to the humble by showing him respect 
                and honor.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest 
            a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, 
            nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be 
            made thee. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the 
            maimed, the lame, the blind: </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> and thou shalt be blessed; for 
            they have not wherewith to 
            recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the 
            just. (<span class="comm">According to the Oriental mode of speech Jesus here emphatically 
                commands one course of action by prohibiting a contrary course. But his 
                prohibition is not to be construed strictly. He does not forbid the exercise of 
                social hospitality, but discountenances that interested form of it 
                which seeks a return. His teaching is positive rather than negative, and should 
                constrain us to live more for charity and less for sociability. Some think that 
                this verse teaches that there shall be two resurrections, but the contrast is 
                not between two times, but rather between two parties or 
                divisions of one resurrection. If one has part in the resurrection of the just, 
                he may expect recompense for his most trivial act. But if he be resurrected 
                among the unjust, he need expect no reward, even for the most meritorious deeds 
                of his whole life.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard 
            these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the 
            kingdom of God. (<span class="comm">The language of Christ implied that God himself would 
                feast those who feasted the poor, and this implication accorded with the Jewish 
                notion that the kingdom of God would be ushered in with a great festival. 
                Inspired by this thought, and feeling confident that he should have been part 
                of the festivities, this guest exclaimed upon the anticipated blessedness.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> But he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade 
            many: </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to 
            them that were bidden, Come; for all
            things are now ready. (<span class="comm">The custom of sending a second 
                invitation at the supper hour is a very old one (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Esther 5: 8; 6: 14</span></span>), and is still observed.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> And they all with 
            one consent began to make 
            excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out 
            and see it; I pray thee have me excused. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And another said, I 
            have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me 
            excused. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore 
            I cannot come. (<span class="comm">These three excuses show: 1. That the guests had made their 
                engagements, either for business or pleasure, without the least regard for the 
                hour of the banquet; 2. That they set little value upon either the friendship 
                or the feast of the one who had invited them. Moreover, the excuses progress in 
                disrespect, for the first excuse is on the ground of necessity, 
                the second simply offers a reason, and the third is almost impudent in its 
                bluntness. Viewing the excuses spiritually, we note that each one contains an 
                element of newness--new field, new oxen, new wife. Thus the things 
                of the earth seem new and sweet in comparison with the gospel invitation. 
                Again, all the excuses are trifling, for the parable is intended to teach that 
                men forego their rights to heaven for trifles. Again, the "sacred 
                hate" of <span class="style7">Luke 14: 25, 26</span> would 
                have eliminated all these excuses. Possibly Paul had this parable in mind when 
                he wrote <span class="style7">1 Corinthians 7: 29-33</span>. 
                The three excuses warn us not to be hindered by 1. the love of possessions; 2. 
                the affairs of business; 3. Our social ties.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span>  And the servant came, and 
            told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to 
            his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring 
            in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame. 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet there is room.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and 
            hedges, and constrain them to 
            come in, that my house may be filled. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> For I say unto you, that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper. (<span class="comm">We have a 
                preliminary or general invitation followed by three special invitations. We may 
                regard the general invitation as given by Moses and the prophets in the ages 
                before the feast was prepared. Then the first special one would be given by 
                John the Baptist and Christ to the Jewish nation in the first stages of 
                Christ's ministry. The second special invitation was given by Christ, the 
                twelve and the seventy, and came more especially to the poor and outcast, the 
                publicans and sinners, because the leading men of the nation spurned the 
                invitation. The third invitation was begun by the apostles after the Lord's 
                ascension and is still borne forward by those who have come after them and 
                includes all nations. The three conditions of Jew, outcast and Gentiles are 
                indicated by the three orders of guests: 1. The honorable citizens of the city; 
                2. Those who frequent the streets and lanes, but are still in and 
                out of the city; 3. Those who live without the city and are found upon the 
                highways and in the hedgepaths of the vineyards and gardens. The second and 
                third classes are depicted as needing to be constrained. This would be so, 
                because they would hold themselves unworthy of the invitation. But they were to 
                be constrained by moral and not by physical means (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 14: 22; 2 Corinthians 12: 11; Galatians 2: 14</span></span>). Physical constraint 
                would have been contrary to all custom, as well as impossible to one servant. 
                Incidentally the parable shows the roominess of heaven and the largeness of 
                divine hospitality, so that Bengel aptly observes, "Grace, no less than 
                nature, abhors a vacuum."</span>)</p>
