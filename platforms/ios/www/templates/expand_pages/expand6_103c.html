        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY IN PER&AElig;A</span>)</h3>
        <h3>THE LOST COIN</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 15: 8-10</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she 
                lose one piece, doth not light a lamp (<span class="comm">because oriental houses are commonly 
                    without windows, and therefore dark</span>), and sweep the house, and seek 
                diligently until she find it?</span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And when she hath found it, she 
                calleth together her friends and neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; 
                for I have found the piece which I had lost. (<span class="comm">The drachma, or piece 
                    of silver, corresponded to the Latin denarius, and was worth about 
                    seventeen cents. The woman, having only ten of them, was evidently poor. Such 
                    small coin have been for centuries worn by oriental women as a sort of 
                    ornamental fringe around the forehead. The phrase "until she find 
                    it," which is practically repeated in both parables, is a sweet source of 
                    hope; but it is not to be pressed so as to contradict other Scripture.</span>) </span></p>

                Even so, I say unto you, there is joy (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ezekiel. 33: 11</span></span>) in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner 
                that repenteth. (<span class="comm">By thus reaffirming the heavenly joy, Jesus sought to 
                    shame the Pharisees out of their cold-blooded murmuring.</span>)</span></p>
