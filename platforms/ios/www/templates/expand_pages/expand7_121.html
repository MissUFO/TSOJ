        <h3>121. DENUNCIATION OF SCRIBES AND PHARISEES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE. TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 23: 1-39;  MARK 12: 38-40; LUKE 20: 45-47.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 23: 1</span> Then spake Jesus  
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 38</span> And in 
            his teaching  in the hearing of all the people he said 
            unto  the multitudes, and to his disciples (<span class="comm">he 
                spoke in the most public manner</span>), 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 23: 2</span> saying,  
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 46</span> Beware of the scribes,  The scribes and the 
            Pharisees sit on Moses' seat: 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 23: 3</span> all things whatsoever they bid 
            you, these do and observe: but 
            do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. (<span class="comm">As teachers of the 
                law of Moses the scribes and Pharisees were the only religious guides whom the 
                people had, so they were obliged to follow them as expounders of that law, but 
                they were no means to look to them as living exemplification of that law.</span>)</p> 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> 
            Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's 
            shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their fingers. (<span class="comm">The 
                law itself was a heavy yoke (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 15: 10</span>
                </span>), but these teachers added to the burden of it a vast volume of traditions, 
                but they themselves did not keep these traditions, excusing themselves by 
                inventing subtle distinctions like those in reference to the Corban (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 15: 16-22</span></span>). See p. 314.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> All 
            their works they do to be seen of men (<span class="comm">what laws and traditions they did 
                keep were not kept privately and sincerely, but publicly that they might secure 
                to themselves a reputation for 

                sanctity</span>): for they make 
            broad their phylacteries (<span class="comm">Literally, preservatives or 
                remembrances. They were probably so called because they were designed to 
                aid the wearer in remembering his obligations to the law. They were strips of 
                parchment on which were written four passages of the law, viz.: <span class="style7">Exodus 13: 3-10; 11-16; Deuteronomy 6: 4-9; 11: 13-21</span>. These were enclosed in a leather case and were 
                fastened to the forehead and left arm. The authority for wearing them was 
                purely traditional, and the practice seems to have arisen from a literal 
                interpretation of <span class="style7">Exodus 13: 9, 16; Deuteronomy 6: 8; 11: 18</span>. The Pharisees made the leather case large, that their 
                righteousness might be more conspicuous, and enlarge the </span>)borders
            of their garments (<span class="comm">These were the 
                fringes mentioned in <span class="style7">Numbers 15: 38, 39</span>. 
                But the Pharisees offended again, even in their obedience, by wearing broader 
                fringes than other people, that they might appear more religious</span>), 
            who desire to walk in long robes (<span class="comm">This robe was a 
                professional dress, as marked as that worn by priests and kings. It showed that 
                its wearer was professionally religious</span>),</p>  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> 
            and love the chief places at feasts (<span class="comm">see p. 493</span>), and chief seats 
            in the synagogues, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> and  lovethe salutations in the marketplaces (<span class="comm">see p. 313</span>), 
            and to be called of men, Rabbi. (<span class="comm">The term "Rabbi" means master 
                or teacher.</span>) </p>  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 47</span> who {<span class="style5">Mark 12: 40</span> they that} devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation. (<span class="comm">It is doubtful in what way the Pharisees devoured widows' houses, or property. Godet suggests that they extorted presents under pretense of interceding for them in their prayers, and Lightfoot thinks that they got the goods of widows &quot;by subtle attractives,&quot; and by the management of their estates as judges, and as men acquainted with the law and therefore fit to administer estates. According to the later rabbinical teaching it is urged that a rabbi should pray one hour, and that he should meditate for an hour before and an hour after prayer. On days when they carried out this rule and the other rule which required three seasons of prayer a day, they would spend nine hours in prayer. But this was no doubt one of the cases where they said and did not. For thus making their religion a cloak for their vices they would be more severely punished. As to the particular blackness of the crime of robbing widows, see <span class="style7">Exodus 22: 22-24; Deuteronomy 27: 19</span>.</span>) </p>  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 23: 8</span> But be not ye called Rabbi: for 
            one is your teacher (<span class="comm">Christ</span>), and all ye are brethren. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father,
            even he who is in heaven. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even the Christ. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> But he that 
            is greatest among you shall be your servant. (<span class="comm">See pp. 557, 558.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And 
            whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble 
            himself shall be exalted. (<span class="comm">See pp. 431, 494, 537. Thus Jesus reproves those 
                who make religion a matter of praise-seeking ostentation, whether they do so by 
                seeking position, or by peculiarity of dress, or by assuming or accepting 
                titles of honor or distinction. This sin of ostentation was the first 
                enumerated sin of the Pharisees.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> But woe unto you, scribes and 
            Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye 
            enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to 
            enter. (<span class="comm">Our Lord's language is figurative and presents the kingdom of God 
                as a house around the door of which the Pharisees have gathered, not entering 
                in themselves, and blocking the way against those who would enter. This they 
                did by their opposition to Jesus. For a similar charge see p. 315.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> Woe 
            unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to 
            make one proselyte; and when he is become so, ye make him twofold more a son of 
            hell than yourselves. (<span class="comm">Proselytes here meant are not those converted from 
                heathenism to worship God, but Jews converted to Phariseeism. These become 
                worse than their instructors, because each generation drifted farther from the 
                law and became more zealously and completely devoted to the traditions.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> 
            Woe unto you, ye blind guides (<span class="comm">Jesus above denounced them for their 
                hypocrisy, but this woe is pronounced upon them for their 

                ignorance and folly</span>), that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, 
            it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a 
            debtor. (<span class="comm">The word "debtor" is here meant to describe one who 
                owes it to himself and to God to keep his oath. The Pharisees graduated oaths 
                according to their own foolish conceptions of the sanctity of the object 
                invoked, so that if the object by which a man swore was not sacred enough, he 
                was not forsworn if he did not keep his oath. Esteeming the gold of the temple 
                more sacred than the temple itself, they held that an oath by the former was 
                binding while an oath by the latter was not. The gold meant is probably the 
                golden ornaments on the temple.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> Ye fools and blind: for which is 
            greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold? </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> 
            And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall 
            swear by the gift that is upon it, he is a debtor. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Ye blind: 
            for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all 
            things thereon. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by 
            it, and by him that dwelleth therein. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And he that sweareth by 
            the heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. 
            (<span class="comm">Our Lord designed to teach that all oaths were binding. See p. 243.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> Woe 
            unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and 
            cummin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law, justice, and 
            mercy, and faith: but these ye ought to have done, and not to have left the 
            other undone. (<span class="comm">See p. 313. The anise was used for medical purposes and also 
                for culinary seasoning, so that Pliny says "the kitchen can not be 
                without it." Cummin also was a condiment and a medicine, the bruised seed 
                mixed with wine being used as a styptic, especially after circumcision. It was 
                also used as an ingredient for salves and plasters such as were applied to the 
                ulcers of cattle produced from the bites, grubs, etc., of insects.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> Ye 
            blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and 

            swallow the 
            camel! (<span class="comm">A proverbial expression, indicating care for little faults and a 
                corresponding unconcern for big ones.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Woe unto you, scribes and 
            Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the 
            platter, but within they are full from extortion and excess. (<span class="comm">Jesus here 
                compares the Pharisees to a woman who washes the outside of her dishes and 
                leaves the inside unclean. But in describing that inner uncleanness he passes 
                from the figure to the reality, and specifies that it consists of extortion and 
                self-indulgence. They made their outside clean by traditionary ablutions. See 
                pp. 393, 394.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup 
            and of the platter, that the outside thereof may become clean also. (<span class="comm">Here 
                again the literal peeps through the figurative: a pure inner life makes clean 
                outward conduct.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye 
            are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly 
            are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> Even so 
            ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of 
            hypocrisy and iniquity. (<span class="comm">Luke records Jesus as having taught this lesson by 
                an exactly opposite figure. See p. 313. There men were contaminated by the 
                touch of a grave because there was nothing outside to notify them of its 
                presence. Here men are contaminated by the same thing because the outside is 
                rendered so white and beautiful that men are deceived into thinking that the 
                inside is harmless.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for 
            ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the 
            righteous, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, 
            we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> Wherefore ye witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of them that 
            slew the prophets. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Fill ye up then the measure of your 
            fathers. (<span class="comm">See p. 314.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall 
            ye escape the judgment of hell? (<span class="comm">See p. 73.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> Therefore, behold, I 
            send unto you 

            prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of 
            them shall ye kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your 
            synagogues, and persecute from city to city: </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> that upon you may 
            come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the 
            righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between 
            the sanctuary and the altar. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> Verily I say unto you, All these
