        <h3>28. THE SECOND MIRACLE AT CANA.</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 4: 46-54.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> He came therefore again (<span class="comm">that is, in consequence of the welcome which awaited him</span>) Unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine (<span class="comm">see page 114</span>). And there was a certain nobleman (<span class="comm">literally, &quot;king's man:&quot; a word which Josephus uses to designate a soldier, courtier, or officer of the king. He was doubtless an officer of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee. That it was Chuzas (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 8: 3</span> </span>) or Manaen (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 13: 1</span> </span>) is mere conjecture</span>), whose son was 
            sick at Capernaum. (<span class="comm">The nouns in this verse are suggestive. We have a 
                "nobleman," yet neither riches nor office lifted him above 
                affliction; a "son," yet approaching an untimely death before his 
                father; and both these parties came to sorrow in "Capernaum," the 
                city of consolation. Neither circumstance, nor age, nor situation can guarantee 
                joy. We must still be seeking Jesus.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span>    When he heard 

            that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee (<span class="comm">and was therefore within 
                not very easy reach of his sick child's bedside</span>), he went unto him
            (<span class="comm">literally, "he went away unto him." The verb contains a delicate 
                suggestion that the father was reluctant to leave the son, even to seek aid</span>)
            , and besought him that 
            he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. 
            (<span class="comm">Many, like this father, only seek divine aid when in the utmost extremity.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe. (<span class="comm">Though Jesus spoke these words to the nobleman, yet he also intended them for those who stood by, for he used the plural &quot;ye.&quot; That the Galil&aelig;ans in general deserved reproof for their lack of faith, is shown by the upbraiding words which he spoke concerning their cities (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 11: 20-24</span> </span>). Jesus wanted men to believe in him because of his self-evidencing character and words (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 10: 38; 14: 11; 15: 22-24; 
                        20: 29</span> </span>). But the people required to have their faith buttressed by miracles. There is a vast difference between believing in a man, and believing his credentials. Miracles were our Lord's credentials; his ministry among men can not be thought of without them; and when the Baptist's faith in Christ himself wavered, Jesus referred him to them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 11: 4, 5</span> </span>). See also  <span class="style7">John 10: 37</span> . The two words, "signs" and "wonders," 
                indicate the two aspects of miracles. To the thoughtful they were signs or 
                attestations that the one who performed them acted under the authority and 
                approval of God; to all others they were mere wonders, which startled by their 
                strangeness. Jesus was fresh from Sychar, where many required no other sign 
                than his words.</span>) </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. (<span class="comm">The father felt that the case was too urgent to admit of delay for argument. It seemed to him that he raced with death. His faith differed from that of the centurion in that he felt that the presence of Jesus was required to perform the miracle. He also regarded the powers of Jesus as limited to the living; but we must not censure his faith as particularly weak, for in both these respects it resembled that possessed by Mary and Martha--<span class="style7">John 11: 21, 22, 32, 39.</span> </span>)  </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span>   Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. (<span class="comm">Jesus enlarges the 
                nobleman's conception of his divine power by showing him that his words take 
                effect without regard to distance.</span>) The man believed the word that Jesus had 
            spake unto him, and he went his way.  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span>   And as he was now going 
            down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived. 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span>   So he 
            inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. (<span class="comm">More correctly, 
                "began to get better." The father expected that the fever would 
                depart slowly, as it usually does; but the reply of the servants shows that he 
                was mistaken.</span>) They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour 
            the fever left him. (<span class="comm">Though for harmonistic reasons we are persuaded that 
                John himself uses the Roman method of computing the hours, which would make the 
                phrase here mean 7 P. M., yet since the phraseology here is not his, but that 
                of the Galil&aelig;an servants, we take it to mean 1 P. M., for they would use 
                the Jewish method of computing from sunset to sunset. If both parties had 
                started at once, they would have met before sundown, as each had but eleven 
                miles to traverse. But it is more reasonable to suppose that the wearied but 
                now believing father sought some refreshment and a brief rest before returning, 
                and that the servants tarried awhile to see if the child's recovery was 
                permanent. This would lead to their meeting after sundown, at which time, 
                according to the invariable custom, they would call the previous period of 
                daylight "yesterday."</span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">53</span>    So the father knew that it was at that 
            hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and 
            his whole house. (<span class="comm">We note here a growth in the faith of the nobleman. He 
                first believed in the power of Jesus' presence, then in the power of 
                Jesus' word, and finally he believed generally in Jesus, and his 
                household shared his belief. This is the first mention of a believing 
                household; for others see  <span class="style7">Acts 16: 14, 15, 34; 18: 8.</span> </span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">54</span>    This is again the second sign that Jesus did, 
            having come out of Jud&aelig;a into Galilee. 

            (<span class="comm">One small sign and many converted in Samaria; two great miracles and one household converted 
                in Galilee. Such is the record. Jesus doubtless had many other converts in 
                Galilee, but it is often true that the greater labor brings the lesser 
                harvest.</span>)</p>
