        <h3>75. PETER'S CONFESSION.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT THE SYNAGOGUE IN CAPERNAUM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 6: 22-71.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">23</span> (<span class="comm">howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the 
                place where they ate the bread after that the Lord had given thanks</span>):
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">24</span> when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. (<span class="comm">This sentence is a complicated one, because it contains much in a condensed form. On the evening of the miracle the multitude had seen that there was but one boat, and that the disciples had gone away in it, leaving Jesus in the mountain. Jesus had dispersed the multitude, but many of them had not gone very far. On the morrow they came again to the scene of the miracle, and were perplexed at not finding Jesus. After some time they became convinced that he was not there, because if he had been, his disciples would have returned to seek him. In the meantime the keen-eyed boatmen about Tiberias, then the largest city on the lake, seeing the multitude on the farther shore, saw in their presence there an opportunity to earn a ferry fee, so they soon crossed the lake to accommodate the people. As Capernaum was the well-known headquarters of Jesus, the boatmen were directed to proceed thither that the multitude might find him.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">25</span> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? (<span class="comm">They found him at Capernaum in the synagogue, having but lately arrived from the land of Gennesaret. Though their question relates only to the time when Jesus crossed, it implies and includes a desire to know the manner also.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">26</span> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily (<span class="comm">his answer was as serious as their question was flippant</span>), I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs (<span class="comm">Jesus includes the healing of the sick as well as the feeding of the multitude</span>), but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled. (<span class="comm">They did not seek Jesus because they saw in him a divine Friend who could satisfy the deep needs of the soul, but as a wonder-worker who could fill their bodies with food when occasion required.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">27</span> Work not for the food which perisheth (<span class="comm">bodily food</span>), but for the food which abideth unto eternal life (<span class="comm">spiritual food</span>), which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed. (<span class="comm">In our land a man consents to and makes a written instrument his own--an expression of his will--by signing it; but in the East he did this by affixing his seal to it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 21: 8; Esther 3: 12; 8: 10; Jeremiah 32: 10</span></span>). The meaning of Jesus' words, therefore, is that God the Father had commissioned him as Messiah, and had authenticated his mission as such by the works which he had given him to do--<span class="style7">John 5: 36</span>.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">28</span> They said therefore unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God? (<span class="comm">They wished to know what to do in order to earn the abiding food; that is, by what works they might so please God as to obtain it. Humanity, in seeking to answer this question, has invented pilgrimages, penances, fasts, mutilations and many other methods of self-punishment; not heeding the plain and decisive answer of Jesus.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">29</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. (<span class="comm">Belief in Jesus as the Son of God is the one all-comprehensive work which pleases God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 11: 6</span></span>). Jesus reiterates this important truth several times in this discourse; see <span class="style7">John 6: 35, 36, 40, 47, etc.</span>, and the doctrine contained in it is elaborated in the epistles of Paul.</span>)       </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">30</span> They said 
            therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and 
            believe thee? what workest thou?
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">31</span> Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. (<span class="comm">The trend of questions and answers in this discourse forms a close parallel to that at <span class="style7">John 4</span>, but with a different conclusion. There Jesus discoursed of life under the figure of water, and here under the figure of bread. There the woman vacillated between her good and evil impulses until her better nature triumphed. Here there was a like vacillation, terminating in opposite result. There the woman compared Jesus with Jacob, the well-digger (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 4: 12</span></span>); here the people compare him with Moses, the manna-giver--each comparing him unfavorably.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">32</span> Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say 
            unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but 

            my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">33</span> For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. (<span class="comm">In testing the claims of Jesus the Jews proceeded upon the hypothesis that the Messiah must be greater than all the prophets, and that this greatness must be authenticated or sealed by greater signs than those wrought by others. Proceeding under this method, they compared the miracle just wrought by Jesus with the fall of manna in the days of Moses and drew conclusions unfavorable to Jesus. They reason thus: &quot;Moses fed many millions for forty years with bread from heaven, but Moses was less than Messiah. This man fed but five thousand for only one day and gave them barley bread. This man is even less than Moses, and consequently far less than the Messiah.&quot;</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">34</span> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. (<span class="comm">They readily recognized the insufficiency of manna and the possibility of God sending a better bread, and in a vague, wondering, half-credulous mood they asked for it just as the woman asked for water (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 4: 15</span></span>). In answer to each set of questions Jesus proceeded to reveal himself, and to show that the blessings sought were not external to himself, but were in himself and were obtained by belief in him. When Jesus stood thus self-revealed, the Samaritan woman believed in him and was satisfied; but these Jews at Capernaum disbelieved and murmured.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">35</span> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. (<span class="comm">Compare <span class="style7">John 4: 10, 13, 14</span>.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">36</span> But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not. (<span class="comm">The personality of Jesus was the great proof of his divinity, but the Jews, though familiar with that personality, refused to consider it, and kept clamoring for a sign. Hence Jesus states the hopelessness of the situation. If one refuses to believe in the sun when he sees its light, feels its heat and witnesses its life-giving power, by what sign will you demonstrate to him the existence of the sun?</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">37</span> All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. (<span class="comm">These words of Christ arise naturally out of the situation. The Jews, having wavered between belief and disbelief, had settled in a proud disbelief which was about to be expressed in murmuring and scorn. They were complacently self-satisfied, and felt that they had displayed great wisdom in arriving at this decision. But Jesus strikes at their pride by informing them that they are not his because God has rejected them as unworthy to be given to him. There is no suggestion or hint that the Father acts arbitrarily in selecting whom he shall give to Christ. The Son of God followed a prescribed course in the winning of men. If this did not win them, it was the Father's decree that they were not his. If this course did win them, Jesus in nowise rejected them, no matter how lowly their station, or how vile their past record.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">38</span> For I am 
            come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent 
            me. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">39</span> And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all which 
            he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last 
            day.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">40</span> For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. (<span class="comm">It was the purpose of God the Father to offer to the sons of men an eternal life through the life-giving power of Jesus Christ. The power which was to work in men a fitness for this exalted honor was a belief in the Son. How could signs and wonders be wrought contrary to the Father's will? They ought to have believed for the signs and wonders he had already wrought, instead of pretending that he had wrought none that were conclusive of his claims.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">41</span> The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, 
            because he said, I am the bread which came down oiut of heaven.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">42</span> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven? (<span class="comm">The Jews had entered with Christ upon a discussion as to whether he was a greater prophet than Moses, and as they denied even this fact, it is not to be wondered that they murmured at the turn which the discussion had taken. In asserting that he came down from heaven, etc., he ascribed to himself a participation in the divine glory which entitled him to an absolute superiority over all men, prophets or others. This claim was to them insufferable, and they thought they had a sufficient answer to it in that they supposed themselves to be acquainted with his birth and parentage.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">43</span> Jesus answered and said unto 
            them, Murmur not among yourselves.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">44</span> No man can come to me, 
            except the Father that sent me draw him. And I will raise him up in the last 
            day. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">45</span> It is written in the prophets (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 54: 13; Jeremiah 31: 33, 34; Joel 3: 16, 17</span></span>), And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me. (<span class="comm">Jesus rebukes their murmuring as out of place. They thought themselves offended by what they believed to be an intolerable assumption on his part. But they were really offended in him for an entirely different cause, viz.: because they were not drawn by the Father. The Father had given the law as a tutor to draw to Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galatians 3: 24</span></span>), and he had also sent forth his prophets for the same purpose. Those who had availed themselves of this instruction, and had learned the Father's lessons, were ready to come to Christ. The sense of misery and desire of redemption begotten by the law drove one to Christ, and all the yearnings and aspirations inspired by the prophets attracted him thither. The Father had taught, but the people had not learned, just as their fathers had not learned; and Jesus accuses them in language kindred to the accusation of Moses when he says, &quot;But Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day&quot; (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 29: 4</span></span>). In each case the people were to blame.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">46</span> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he that is from God, he hath seen the Father. (<span class="comm">The Jews might have construed the words of Jesus as indicating an immediate relation to the Father and of obtaining instruction directly from him. Such a doctrine would strike at the mediation of Christ. Jesus therefore guards against this false apprehension by denying humanity's direct access to God the Father, and claiming it as his own exclusive right. The teaching of the Father which he spoke of was obtained through the Scriptures and (<span class="comm">in earlier times</span>) the prophets, who were the authors of the Scriptures.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">47</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath 
            everlasting life.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">48</span> I am the bread of life. (<span class="comm">Jesus here reasserts the proposition to which the Jews had objected. Having paused to speak of the cause of their objections, he now asserts the main propositions, that he may enlarge upon them.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">49</span> Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. (<span class="comm">Manna did not stay death. During the forty years' sojourn in the wilderness all the grown men who started from Egypt died save two.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">50</span> This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. (<span class="comm">He quietly condescends to contrast the two breads. Manna simply sustained the body like any other natural food; it did no more. Jesus is supernatural food; he sustains the spirit unto eternal life.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">51</span> I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world. (<span class="comm">He had declared himself to be the bread of life, but bread must be assimilated. The assimilation of natural bread requires eating, but Jesus, the spiritual bread, is assimilated by believing on him. But he was not then perfected as the bread of life. It was necessary that he should sacrifice himself for our sins before sins could be forgiven, and it was necessary for sins to be forgiven before men could have life with God. By his sacrifice on the cross he opened the fountain of forgiveness. By raising his humanity from the dead and by taking it with him in his ascension into heaven, he showed the results which men may expect to accrue to them by his death upon the cross.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">52</span> The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? (<span class="comm">They were not all of one mind with regard to Christ, and they discussed from opposite sides the problem raised by these mysterious words.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">53</span> Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves. (<span class="comm">He here expressed in words what he afterward expressed in symbols, when he gave the Lord's supper. The vital force of a disciple is proportioned to his belief in, remembrance of, and desire to assimilate the Christ.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">54</span> He that eateth my flesh and 
            drinketh my blood hath eternal life. And I will raise him up at the last 
            day. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">55</span> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. (<span class="comm">The flesh to be eaten must be broken, and the blood, if it is to be drunk, must be poured out. Christ speaks of himself as the sacrifice given for the saving of the world, and one must appropriate to himself by faith this expiation and find in it reconciliation with God if he would live; but the next verse enlarges the thought and shows that it includes more than the idea of expiation.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">56</span> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. (<span class="comm">The thought of drinking blood was startling to the Jew, for he was forbidden to taste even the blood of animals, and the reason assigned was very pertinent--because the blood was the life of the animal (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 9: 4; Leviticus 17: 10-14</span></span>). By insisting, therefore, on the drinking of his blood, Jesus has insisted that his very life be absorbed and assimilated. To be disciples of other teachers it is only necessary that we accept and follow their doctrine. But to be a disciple of Christ is to do more than this. His divinity permits us to have a spiritual communion and fellowship with him, an abiding in his presence, an indwelling of his Spirit, and a veritable assimilation of life from him. Were it otherwise he could not be food for the spirit--bread of life. He had started to show to the Jews that he was to the spirit what bread was to the body. It was difficult to bring home to their carnal minds so spiritual a thought, and therefore Jesus clothed it in carnal metaphors and made it as plain as possible. Christians to-day, being more spiritually minded, and more used to spiritual language, are somewhat confused by the carnal dress in which Jesus clothed his thought.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">57</span> As the living Father sent me, and I live necause of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me. (<span class="comm">The result of our union or abiding with Christ is a perfect life. The life of the Father enters the soul of the disciple through the mediatorship of the Son. The Father, who is the fountain of life, sent forth the Son that he might bestow it upon all who believe in him and abide in him.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">58</span> This is that bread which came out of heaven: not as the fathers ate and died; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever. (<span class="comm">Thus Jesus sums up the comparison which the Jews had thrust upon him between himself and the manna.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">59</span> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. (<span class="comm">It was in the synagogue built by the centurion, which we have before mentioned. Pots of manna appear to have been engraved upon its walls, possibly upon the frieze, for Colonel Wilson says of it: &quot;It was not without a certain strange feeling that, on turning over one of the blocks (<span class="comm">in the ruins</span>), we found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words, 'I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.'&quot;</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">60</span> Many therefore of his 
            disciples, when they had heard this,
            said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">61</span> But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, 
            Doth this cause you to stumble? 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">62</span> What then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before? (<span class="comm">If the prophecy of his sacrifice disturbed their dreams of a temporal kingdom, what would be the effect of his ascension on those dreams? The Book of Acts answers our Lord's question. In the very hour of the ascension the very apostles were still expecting the revival of the kingdom of David, with Jerusalem for its capital. But ten days later, at Pentecost, they had abandoned the earthly idea and looked upon Jesus as enthroned at the right hand of God--<span class="style7">Acts 1: 6; 2: 32-36</span>.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">63</span> It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, are are life. (<span class="comm">Jesus here tells them plainly that his words relate to the spiritual realm, and to life in that realm. It is his Spirit in our spirit which gives eternal life. His flesh in our flesh would profit nothing, even were a priest able, by his blessing, to perform the miracle of transubstantiation. The life-principle of Jesus lay in his divinity, and his divinity lay in his Spirit, and not in his flesh. We would not come in contact with his divinity by eating that which represented his humanity.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">64</span> But there are some of you that believe not. 
            For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who 
            should betray him.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">65</span> And he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of my Father. (<span class="comm">Jesus here distinguishes between those who were drawn to him by divine influences, and who were therefore ready to follow him as he really was, and those who were drawn to him by mistaken notions concerning him, and who would desert him as soon as they discovered that their conceptions of him were incorrect. He knew the reason which prompted each to become his disciple.</span>)

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">66</span> Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. (<span class="comm">He had sifted them, for their false following could be of no benefit either to them or to his kingdom.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">67</span> Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would ye also go away? (<span class="comm">Jesus had sifted the outer circle of his disciples, and the loss, though prophetically anticipated, was not without its pang. In this sixty-seventh verse he proceeds to sift the innermost circle, and his words are full of pathos. By giving them an opportunity to depart he called forth from them an expression of loyalty which bound them more closely to him.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">68</span> Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of 
            eternal life.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">69</span> And we have believed and know that thou art the 
            Holy One of God. 

        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">70</span> Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the 
            twelve, and one of you is a devil?
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"> <span class="style5">71</span> Now he spake of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve. (<span class="comm">We have seen from <span class="style7">John 6: 64</span> that Jesus has already had the betrayer in his mind. Here he speaks of him openly. In a discourse which forecasted his passion it was natural that he should allude to his betrayer, especially, when his presence enforced remembrance. But there was another reason to mention him at this time. He was an illustration of the truth that no man could be a real follower of Jesus unless he became such by the drawing of the Father.</span>)        </p>
