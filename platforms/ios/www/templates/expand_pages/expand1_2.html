        <h3>I. JOHN'S INTRODUCTION. </h3>
        <h3>JOHN I. 1-18.</h3> 
        <p class="style4"> <span class="style5">1</span> In the beginning was the Word (<span class="comm">a title for Jesus peculiar to the apostle John</span>), and the Word was with God (<span class="comm">not going before nor coming after God, but with Him at the beginning</span>), and the Word was God. (<span class="comm">Not more, not less.</span>)</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> All things were made through him (<span class="comm">the New Testament often speaks of Christ as the Creator -- see <span class="style7">ver. 10; I. Cor. viii. 6; Col. i. 13, 17; Heb. i. 2</span></span>) and without him was not anything made that hath been made. (<span class="comm">This shows that Jesus himself is not a creature.</span>)</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> In him was life [<span class="comm">As in the Father (<span class="comm">chap. v. 26</span>). As this life animates the living, so can it reanimate the dead--John xi. 25</span>]; and the life was the light of men. [<span class="comm">The life of Jesus is the light of men, because from that life we get our intellect and understanding, and because that life formed and governs the creation around us by which we become enlightened as to the existence and power of God--Rom. i. 18-21; Acts xiv. 16, 17.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And the light shineth in the darkness [<span class="comm">an ignorant, benighted world</span>]; and the darkness apprehended it not. [<span class="comm">Did not receive or admit it. Jesus, the Light of the world, was despised and rejected by men.</span>]  </p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light. [<span class="comm">that he might tell men that Jesus was the Messiah</span>], that all [<span class="comm">who heard his testimony</span>] might believe [<span class="comm">in Jesus</span>] through him.</p>
        <p class="style4"> <span class="style5">8</span> He was not the light [<span class="comm">&quot;He was the lamp that burneth and shineth&quot; (<span class="comm">chap. v. 35</span>); but not the Sun of righteousness-- [<span class="comm">2</span>] Mal. iv. 2</span>], but came that he might bear witness of the light.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> There was the true light [<span class="comm">as opposed to the imperfect, incomplete, and transitory lights</span>], even the light which lighteth every man [<span class="comm">all men are enlightened in some degree and enlightened of Christ: some by nature, some by conscience, and some by Bible revelation</span>], coming into the world.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> He was in the world. [<span class="comm">invisibly present, renewing and sustaining his creation</span>], and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not. [<span class="comm">Though it might and should have known him--Rom. i. 18-21; Acts xiv. 16, 17.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> He came [<span class="comm">visibly in the flesh</span>] unto his own [<span class="comm">his own land or possessions--Hos. ix. 3; Jer. ii. 7; Zech. ii. 12</span>], and they that were his own [<span class="comm">the children of Israel--Ex. xix. 5; Deut. vii. 6; xiv. 2</span>] received him not.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> But as many as received him [<span class="comm">whether Jew or Gentile</span>], to them gave he the right to become children of God [<span class="comm">comp. Rom. iii. 14-17; Gal. iii. 26; iv. 6, 7; I. John iii. 1, 2</span>], even to them that believe on his name:</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> who were born, not of blood [<span class="comm">descent from Abraham, David or any other godly person does not make a man a child of God--Luke iii. 8; Matt. iii. 9; ch. viii. 39, 40; Gal. iii. 6, 7, 29</span>], nor of the will of the flesh [<span class="comm">the efforts and exertions of our own human hearts and natures may reform, but can not regenerate, the life--ch. iii. 6</span>], nor of the will of man [<span class="comm">we are not begotten of God by the acts and deeds of our fellow-men, however much they may aid us in leading right lives</span>], but of God. [<span class="comm">Ch. iii. 5; I. John iv. 7; v. 1.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And the Word became flesh [<span class="comm">by being born in Bethlehem of the Virgin Mary</span>], and dwelt among us, (<span class="comm">and we beheld his glory [<span class="comm">in his miracles, and especially in his transfiguration--ch. ii. 11; II. Pet. i. 16-18</span>], glory as of the only begotten from the Father</span>) [<span class="comm">such glory as was suitable to the Son of God</span>], full of grace and truth. [<span class="comm">The glory of Christ was not in pomp and worldly grandeur, but in the holiness, grace, and truth of his daily life.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> John [<span class="comm">the Baptist</span>] beareth witness of him [<span class="comm">the words of John the Baptist still witness to unbelieving Jews and Gentiles</span>], and crieth, [<span class="comm">3</span>] saying, This was he of whom I said [<span class="comm">John had preached about Jesus before Jesus appeared; he now points to Jesus as the one about whom he had preached</span>], He that cometh after me [<span class="comm">He for whom I as a forerunner have prepared the way--Matt. iii. 3</span>] is become before me [<span class="comm">is worthy of more honor and reverence than am I</span>]: for he was before me. [<span class="comm">Though born into the world six months later than John, Jesus, as the Word, had existed from eternity. (<span class="comm">In verse 16 the words are the apostle John's, and not John the Baptist's.</span>)</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> For of his fulness [<span class="comm">Jesus was full of grace and truth--and all the attributes of God--Eph. i. 23; iii. 19; iv. 13; Col. i. 19; ii. 9</span>] we all received [<span class="comm">by union with him all his perfection and righteousness became ours--Phil. i. 10, 11; iii. 8, 9; I. Cor. i. 30</span>], and grace for grace. [<span class="comm">This may mean that we receive a grace kindred to or like each several grace that is in Christ (<span class="comm">Rom. viii. 29; xii. 2; Eph. iv. 11-13</span>). But it more probably means fullness of grace, or fresh grace daily added to the grace already bestowed.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> For the law [<span class="comm">the Old Dispensation with its condemnation (<span class="comm">Rom. iii. 20; Gal. ii. 21</span>) and its types and shadows--Col. ii. 16, 17; Heb. viii. 4, 5; x. 1</span>] was given through Moses [<span class="comm">by angels at Mt. Sinai--Heb. ii. 2</span>]; grace and truth [<span class="comm">the New Dispensation with its justification (<span class="comm">Rom. iii. 21-26</span>) and its realities--Heb. ix. 1-15</span>] came through Jesus Christ. [<span class="comm">Heb. i. 1, 2; ii. 3.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> No man hath seen God at any time [<span class="comm">I. John iv. 12, 20; ch. i. 18; I. Tim. vi. 16</span>]; the only begotten Son [<span class="comm">the word &quot;only begotten&quot; indicates that none other bears with Christ a like relationship to God</span>], who is in the bosom of the Father [<span class="comm">who bears the closest and tenderest relationship and fellowship as to the Father</span>], he hath declared him. [<span class="comm">Ch. iii. 2; ch. xv. 9; Col. i. 15.</span>] [<span class="comm">4</span>]<br>
          <br>
          2. ANNUNCIATION TO ZACHARIAS OF THE BIRTH <br>
OF JOHN THE BAPTIST. <br>
(<span class="comm">At Jerusalem. Probably B. C. 6.</span>)<br>
<span class="style5">LUKE I. 5-25 </span> </p>
        <p class="style4"> <span class="style5">5</span> There was in the days of Herod, the king of Jud&aelig;a [<span class="comm">a Jewish proselyte, an Idum&aelig;an or Edomite by birth, founder of the Herodian family, king of Jud&aelig;a from B.&nbsp;C. 40 to A.&nbsp;D. 1, made such by the Roman Senate on the recommendation of Mark Antony and Octavius C&aelig;sar</span>], a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course [<span class="comm">David divided the priests into twenty-four bodies or courses, each course serving in rotation one week in the temple (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">I Chron. xxiv. 3-19</span></span>). Of these courses that of Abijah was the eighth</span>] of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron [<span class="comm">The Baptist was of the priestly race by both parents, a family distinction much esteemed among the Jews. He who was thus doubly a priest proclaimed Him who changed the priesthood</span>], and her name was Elisabeth. [<span class="comm">She was named after her ancestress Elisheba, the wife of Aaron.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And they were both righteous before God [<span class="comm">that is, truly righteous, or righteous in God's judgment, and not in mere appearance--<span class="style7">Gen. vii. 1</span></span>], walking in all the commandments and ordinances [<span class="comm">Strictly construed, commandments would refer to moral, and ordinances to ceremonial laws. The two words include all the positive and negative precepts</span>] of the Lord blameless.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And they had no child [<span class="comm">this fact was a reproach and shame to her, barrenness being considered even a punishment for sin by many</span>], because that Elisabeth was barren [<span class="comm">the births of Isaac, Samson, Samuel and the Baptist were all contrary to nature, and were faint foreshadowings of the greater miracle which took place in the birth of our Lord</span>], and they both were now well stricken in years.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And it came to pass, [<span class="comm">9</span>] that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course [<span class="comm">that is, when it came the turn of his course to minister in the temple</span>],</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> according to the custom [<span class="comm">there were many duties in the temple service, and the priests in each course daily drew lots for these duties</span>] of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple [<span class="comm">not that group of buildings, courts, and enclosures which was all called the temple; but the real sanctuary itself, the small but holy building which took the place of the tabernacle of the wilderness</span>] of the Lord and burn incense. [<span class="comm">Made of a mixture of sweet spices. The temple incense was made of stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense, in equal parts, beaten very small--<span class="style7">Ex. xxx. 7, 8, 34-38.</span></span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> The whole multitude [<span class="comm">the presence of the multitude indicates that it was a sabbath or a feast day</span>] of the people were praying [<span class="comm">Incense is a symbol of prayer (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ps. cxli. 1, 2; Rev. viii. 3</span></span>). Each of the multitude prayed in silence</span>] without [<span class="comm">outside the sanctuary, in the temple courts, particularly the court of the women</span>] at the time of incense. [<span class="comm">Incense was offered evening and morning (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ex. xxx. 1-8</span></span>). Probably at 9 A.&nbsp;M. and at 3 P.&nbsp;M. Compare Acts iii. 1. The text favors the idea that Zacharias' vision came in the morning.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And there appeared unto him [<span class="comm">one of God's invisible messengers who came visibly--<span class="style7">II. Kings vi. 17; Ps. xxxiv. 7</span></span>] an angel of the Lord [<span class="comm">Luke frequently tells of the ministration of angels (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">ch. i. 26; ii. 9, 13, 21; xii. 8; xv. 10; xvi. 22; xxii. 43; xxiv. 4, 23</span></span>). They are also often mentioned in the Book of Acts. There had been no appearance of an angel for about four hundred years</span>] standing on the right side [<span class="comm">the place of honor and dignity--<span class="style7">Acts vii. 56</span></span>] of the altar of incense. [<span class="comm">The altar on which Zacharias was burning incense. It stood in theHoly Place in front of the veil which hung between the holy and the most holy places. It was a small table twenty-two inches in breadth and length and forty-four inches in height. It was made of acacia wood, and overlaid with gold--<span class="style7">Ex. xxxvii. 25.</span></span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And Zacharias was troubled [<span class="comm">as men always are at the sight of heavenly beings [<span class="comm">10</span>] --<span class="style7">Gen. iii. 9, 10; Dan. x. 7-12; Rev. i. 17, 18</span></span>] when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> But the angel said unto him, Fear not [<span class="comm">These are the first words of the gospel which began at that hour to unfold itself</span>], Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. [<span class="comm">This name means &quot;the Lord is gracious,&quot; or &quot;the Lord is merciful.&quot;</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And thou shalt have joy and gladness [<span class="comm">thou shalt feel as Abraham did when he named his new-born son Isaac; that is, &quot;Laughter&quot;</span>]; and many [<span class="comm">but not all</span>] shall rejoice at his birth.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord [<span class="comm">compare verse 6</span>], and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink. [<span class="comm">Strong drink is any other fermented liquor. Wycliffe's version calls it &quot;syder,&quot; and the Anglo-Saxon version calls it &quot;beor,&quot; of which palm wine was the most common kind. As to the temperance of the Baptist, compare the history of Samson (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Judg. xiii. 3-5</span></span>) and the law of the Nazarite--<span class="style7">Num. vi. 2-4</span></span>]; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit [<span class="comm">the stimulation of the Spirit is elsewhere thus contrasted with alcoholic stimulants--<span class="style7">Acts ii. 15-18; Eph. v. 18</span></span>], even from his mother's womb. [<span class="comm">See verse 41.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God. [<span class="comm">These words were quoted from Mal. iv. 6, and resumed the thread of prophecy which had been broken nearly four centuries before. Roman rule had brought in the vices and profligacy of Italy and Greece, and the nation needed to turn back to its former godly life.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And he shall go before his face [<span class="comm">the face of Messiah, who is also the Lord God--<span class="style7">Mal. iii. 1</span></span>] in the spirit and power of Elijah [<span class="comm">And thus in fulfillment of the prophecy that Elijah should come again (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mal. iv. 6; Matt. xvii. 9-13</span></span>). The Jews still expect Elijah as the forerunner of Messiah. John showed the spirit of Elijah in his ascetic dress and life (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">II. Kings i. 8; Matt. iii. 4</span></span>) and in his message of repentance -- <span class="style7">I. Kings xviii. 21-40</span></span>], to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. [<span class="comm">&quot;These are the last words of the Old [<span class="comm">11</span>] Testament, there used by a prophet; here expounded by an angel; there concluding the law; here beginning the gospel.&quot; The phrase may mean: 1. John will restore unity to the families of Israel, now divided into political factions, as Herodians or friends of Rome, and zealots or patriots; and into religious factions, as Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, etc.; or more likely it may mean, 2. That John would restore the broken relationship between the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their degenerate descendants--<span class="style7">Isa. xxix. 22, 23; lxiii. 16; John viii. 37-40</span></span>], and the disobedient to walk in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him. [<span class="comm">As in the East the &quot;friend,&quot; or go-between, prepares the bride to understand and appreciate her bridegroom--<span class="style7">John iii. 28, 29</span>.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? [<span class="comm">In asking for a sign Zacharias showed his unbelief (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matt. xii. 38, 39</span></span>). His question in the original is in four words. Four faithless words cost him forty weeks of silence.</span>] for I am an old man [<span class="comm">So said Abraham (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Gen. xvii. 17</span></span>). The law which retired Levites from service at the age of fifty years (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Num. viii. 25, 26</span></span>) did not apply to priests. They served to extreme old age</span>], and my wife well stricken in years.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel [<span class="comm">This name means &quot;hero, or mighty one, of God.&quot; Gabriel announced to Daniel the time of Christ's birth and death, and the overthrow and final restoration of the Jewish nation (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Dan. vii.-xii.</span></span>). He also announced the birth of Jesus to Mary(<span class="comm">verse 26</span>). The Bible gives the name of but one other angel; viz.: Michael, meaning &quot;Who is like God?&quot; Since Gabriel was the messenger who announced God's merciful and gracious purposes, and Michael the one who executed his decrees and punishments, the Jews had a beautiful saying that &quot;Gabriel flew with two wings, and Michael with only one.&quot; The very ancient book of Enoch (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jude 14</span></span>) gives us the name of two other archangels; viz.: Uriel, meaning &quot;God is light&quot;; and Raphael, meaning &quot;healer of God&quot;</span>], that stand in the presence of God [<span class="comm">Seven angels are [<span class="comm">12</span>] spoken of as standing in the presence of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Rev. viii. 2</span></span>) and may probably be called angels of the presence (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isa. lxiii. 9</span></span>). But to see the face of God is no doubt accorded to all angels (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matt. xviii. 10</span></span>). One who stands in the presence of God should be believed by men without approving signs</span>]; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings. [<span class="comm">Our word &quot;gospel&quot; means good tidings.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And, behold, thou shalt be silent [<span class="comm">it was a sign; and also a punishment for having sought a sign</span>] and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried [<span class="comm">The Jews considered slow service as irreverent and displeasing to God. The punishment attached to displeasing service made them fearful-- <span class="style7">Lev. xvi. 13</span></span>] in the temple.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them [<span class="comm">Could not dismiss them with the usual blessing (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Num. vi. 23-26</span></span>). Disbelief is always powerless to bless</span>]: and they perceived [<span class="comm">probably by his excited manner</span>] that he had seen a vision [<span class="comm">the most vivid and objective of all spiritual phenomena--<span class="style7">ch. xxiv. 23; Acts xxvi. 19; II. Cor. xii. 1; Dan. ix. 23</span></span>] in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration [<span class="comm">They are said to have lasted from the evening of one Sabbath (<span class="comm">Friday at sundown</span>) to the morning of the next. Though doubtless chagrined at the punishment which had come upon him, the old priest remained at his post, and dwelt in the temple until his week was finished</span>] were fulfilled, he departed unto his house. [<span class="comm">Some guess that he lived at Hebron, others at Jutta, five miles south of Hebron, others at Ain Karim, four miles west of Jerusalem, but no one knows.</span>]</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">24 </span>And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself [<span class="comm">probably through mingled feelings of modesty, humility, devotion, and joy</span>] five months [<span class="comm">at the end of which time her seclusion was interrupted by the visit [<span class="comm">13</span>] of Mary</span>], saying,</p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Thus [<span class="comm">graciously and mercifully</span>] hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach [<span class="comm">the reproach of being childless--<span class="style7">Gen. xxx. 23</span></span>] among men.</p>
