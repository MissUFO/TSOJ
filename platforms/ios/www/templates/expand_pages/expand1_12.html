        <h3> 12. OUT OF EGYPT</h3>
        <h3> (EGYPT AND NAZARETH, B.C. 4.)</h3>
        <h3> MATTHEW 2: 19-23; LUKE 2: 39.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> But when Herod was dead (<span class="comm">He died in the 
                thirty-seventh year of his reign and the seventieth of his life. A frightful 
                inward burning consumed him, and the stench of his sickness was such that his 
                attendants could not stay near him. So horrible was his condition that he even 
                endeavored to end it by suicide</span>), behold, an angel of the Lord 
            (<span class="comm">word did not come by the infant Jesus; he was "made like unto his 
                brethren" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 2: 17</span></span>) and being a child, &quot;he spake as a child&quot;(<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 13: 11</span></span>), and not as an oracle</span>] appeareth in a dream to 
            Joseph in Egypt (<span class="comm">Joseph had obeyed the command given at (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 2:13</span></span>), and God kept the promise contained 
                therein. God ever keeps covenant with the obedient</span>), saying,</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> Arise (<span class="comm">Happy Joseph! his path was ordered of God. Let us also 
                seek such ordering. "in all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct 
                thy paths -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Proverbs 3: 6</span></span>) and take 
                the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel (<span class="comm">The phrase 
                    "land of Israel" originally meant all Palestine, but during the 
                    period of the kingdom of the ten tribes it was restricted to their portion of 
                    the country. After the captivities and the return of Judah from Babylon the 
                    phrase resumed its original meaning, and hence it is here used to include all 
                    Palestine. As Jesus was "not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of 
                    Israel" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 15: 24</span></span>), it was 
                    fitting that he return thither from Egypt</span>); for they 
                (<span class="comm">"They" is doubtless the plural of majesty; though it may include 
                    others unknown to us, who were employed by him or advised him</span>) are dead 
                (<span class="comm">How prophetic the words! Christ's enemies die, but he lives on. How 
                    innumerable this host of opposers! Persecutors, oppressors, infidels, critics, 
                    literatures, organizations, principalities, and powers, a vast and 
                    motley array of forces, have sought the life of Jesus, have made a great noise 
                    in the world, and died away in silence. Pharoahs, Neros, Diocletians, many a 
                    Charles, Torquemada and Bloody Mary have come up and gone down, but the king of 
                    Israel lives on</span>) that sought the young child's life.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span>  And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came (<span class="comm">The length of his 
                sojourn in Egypt is uncertain. It is variously estimated at from two weeks to 
                more than seven months</span>) into the land of Israel.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> But when he heard (<span class="comm">Joseph heard this on entering Palestine. As he knew of Herod's death by revelation, and hence before any one else in Egypt, there was no one there to tell him who succeeded Herod</span>) that Archelaus (<span class="comm">By his last will and testament Herod divided his kingdom among three of his sons, and Augustus C&aelig;sar consented to the provision of this will. Archelaus, under the title of Ethnarch, received Jud&aelig;a, Idum&aelig;a, and Samaria; Antipas, under the title of Tetrarch, received Galilee and Per&aelig;a; and Philip, under the title of Tetrarch, received Trachonitis (<span class="comm">with Itur&aelig;a</span>), Batan&aelig;a, and Auranitis. Each of these sons bore the name of Herod, like their father. Augustus withheld from Archelaus the title of king, promising it to him &quot;if he governed that part virtuously.&quot; But in the very beginning of his reign he massacred three thousand Jews at once, in the temple, at the time of the Passover, because they called for justice upon the agents who performed the barbarities of his father's reign. Not long after this a solemn embassy of the Jews went to Rome, and petitioned Augustus to remove Archelaus, and make his kingdom a Roman province. After a reign of nine years, Archelaus was banished to Vienne, in Gaul, where he died in A.D. 6. After him Jud&aelig; and had no more native kings, and the scepter was clean departed from Judah. The land became a Roman province, and its governors were successively Quirinius, Coponius, Ambivius, Annius Rufus, Valerius Gratus, and Pontius Pilate</span>) was reigning over Jud&aelig;a in the room of his father Herod (<span class="comm">These words sound like an echo of those employed by the embassy just referred to, for it said to Augustus concerning this man, &quot;He seemed to be so afraid lest he should not be deemed Herod's own son, that he took special care to prove it&quot;</span>), he was afraid to go thither (<span class="comm">As Matthew has spoken of Joseph residing at Bethlehem (<span class="comm">and he did reside there for quite awhile after the birth of Jesus</span>), the use of word &quot;thither&quot; implies that Joseph planned to return to that town. Mary had kindred somewhere in the neighborhood (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1: 36, 39, 40</span></span>), and doubtless both parents thought that David's city was the most fitting place for the nurture of David's heir</span>]; and being warned of God in a dream (<span class="comm">God permitted Joseph to follow the bent of his fear. Joseph's obedience shows him a fit person for the momentous charge entrusted to him</span>), { they returned} he withdrew [<span class="comm">From the territory of Archelaus to that of Antipas, who was a man of much milder disposition. As the brothers were on no good terms, Joseph felt sure that in no case would Antipas deliver him and his to Archelaus</span>] into the parts of Galilee (<span class="comm">It means &quot;circuit.&quot; It is the northern of the three divisions of the Holy Land. Its population was very dense, and was a mixture of Jews and Gentiles. Hence all Galil&aelig;ans were despised by the purer Jews of Jud&aelig;a</span>),</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth; 
            their own city (<span class="comm">This town lies on a hillside, girt in 
                by fifteen higher hills. It is a secluded nook. Here Jesus grew up in obscurity 
                till he reached his thirtieth year. Here he spent about nine-tenths of his 
                earthly life. Sweet humility! Lowliness is as rare and precious a virtue as 
                pride is a plentiful and repugnant vice</span>)   that it might be 
            fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets (<span class="comm">Matthew uses the plural, 
                "prophets," because this prophecy is not the actual words of any 
                prophet, but is the general sense of many of them. We have noted three kinds of 
                prophecy; this is the fourth kind, viz.: one where the very trend or general 
                scope of Scripture is itself a prophecy</span>), that he should be called a 
            Nazarene. (<span class="comm">The Hebrew word netzer means "branch" or 
                "sprout." It is used figuratively for that which is lowly or 
                despised (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 17: 9; Ezekiel 15: 1-6; Malachi 4: 1</span></span>). See also (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 15: 
                        6; Rom. 11: 21</span></span>).  Now, Nazareth, if derived from netzer, 
                answered to its name, and was a despised place (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 45, 46</span></span>), and Jesus, though in truth a Bethlehemite, bore the 
                name Nazarene because it fitly expressed the contempt of those who despised and 
                rejected him.</span>) </p>
