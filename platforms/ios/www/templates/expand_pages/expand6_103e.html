        <h3>103E. SECOND GROUP OF PARABLES</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY IN PER&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>THE UNRIGHTEOUS STEWARD</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 16: 1-18</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> And he said also unto the disciples (<span class="comm">If we 
                remember that many publicans were now taking their stand among Jesus' 
                disciples, we will more readily understand why Jesus addressed to them a 
                parable about an unjust man. They would be more readily affected by such a 
                story</span>), There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same 
            was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods. (<span class="comm">"Wasting" 
                of this verse and "wasted" of <span class="style7">Luke 15: 13</span> are parts of the same verb. The attitude of the two brethren to 
                their father's estate, as set forth in the previous parable, introduced 
                thoughts as to the proper relation which a man bears to his possessions, and 
                these relations Jesus discusses in this parable. While no parable has been so 
                diversely explained, yet the trend of interpretation has been in the main 
                satisfactory. In  <span class="style7">Luke 16: 8</span> the Lord 
                himself gives the key to the parable, which is that the children of light, in 
                the conduct of their affairs, should emulate the wisdom and prudence of the 
                children of the world in the conduct of their affairs. The difficulty of the 
                parable is more apparent than real. The whole parabolic machinery is borrowed 
                from worldly and irreligious life, where dishonest cunning and rascality are 
                freely tolerated. The child of light is equally shrewd and wise in the 
                management of his affairs; using, however, only those means and methods 
                which are permissible in his sphere of action. God's word, of course, 
                nowhere teaches the absurdity that sinful methods are permitted to 
                him whom it calls to lead a sinless life. While the steward's conduct teaches 
                valuable lessons, the steward himself is condemned as an 
                "unrighteous" man in <span class="style7"> Luke 16: 8.</span></span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of 
            thee? (<span class="comm">an indignant expression of surprise arising from abused confidence</span>) 
            render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer 
            steward. (<span class="comm">Ordinarily the stewards were slaves; but this was evidently a 
                free man, for he was neither punished nor sold, but discharged.</span>)
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And the 
            steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away 
            the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig (<span class="comm">Being too weak in body 
                because of my luxurious living. Digging refers generally to agricultural 
                labor</span>); to beg I am ashamed. (<span class="comm">Being too strong in pride because 
                of my exalted manner of life.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> I am resolved what to do (<span class="comm">a way of 
                escape comes to him in a sudden flash of discovery</span>), that, when I am 
            put out of the stewardship, they (<span class="comm">my lord's debtors</span>) may receive me into 
            their houses.</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And calling to him each of his lord's debtors, he 
            said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And he 
            said, A hundred measures of oil. (<span class="comm">The measure mentioned here is the Hebrew 
                bath, which corresponded roughly to a firkin, or nine gallons.</span>) And 
            he said unto him, Take thy bond (<span class="comm">literally, writings</span>), and sit 
            down quickly and write fifty. (<span class="comm">The amount remitted here--450 gallons 
                of olive oil--represented a large sum of money. Such a reduction would put 
                the debtor under great obligation to the steward.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> Then said he to 
            another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. 
            (<span class="comm">The measure here is the Hebrew cor, which contains ten baths, or 
                ephahs, or, more exactly, eighty-six and seven-tenths gallons.</span>) He saith 
            unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore. (<span class="comm">The amount remitted was 
                about 267 bushels, and the debtor himself altered the writing, that he might be 
                in no uncertainty about it. Scholars disagree as to whether these debtors were 
                tenants or traders; i.e., 
                purchasers of produce who had 
                given their bonds or notes for the same. Meyer, Trench, Godet, and others favor 
                this latter view, but the language used and the customs of the land rather 
                indicate that the former is correct. In the East rents are in proportion to the 
                crop, and hence they vary as it varies. It was natural, therefore, that the 
                steward should ask the amount of the rent; and also natural, since rents were 
                thus payable in kind, that the tenant should answer as to the very thing owed. 
                A trader would have been held, not for the purchase, but for the 
                price, and would rather have specified the money due than the quantity or 
                thing bought. Since the price of produce varies, it has been the immemorial 
                custom everywhere to fix the amount to be paid for it at the very time it is 
                purchased, and this amount becomes the debt.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And his lord commended the 
            unrighteous steward because he had done wisely (<span class="comm">shrewdly</span>): for 
            the sons of this world are for their own generation (<span class="comm">their own clan or 
                class</span>) wiser than the sons of light. (<span class="comm">That is to say, the steward, a 
                worldly-minded rascal, knew better how to deal with a worldly-minded master 
                above him and dishonest tenants beneath him, than a son of light knows how to 
                deal with the God over him and his needy brethren about him. The verse 
                contrasts the sons of two households: the children of the worldly household 
                exercise more forethought and prudence in gaining among their brethren friends 
                for the day of need, and in expending money to that end, than do the children 
                of the light. The "devil's martyrs," in their skillful prudence, 
                often shame the saints. If the latter showed a wisdom in their affairs 
                analogous to that which the unjust steward employed in his affairs, God would 
                commend them as the lord commended the steward.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And I say unto you, Make 
            to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness (<span class="comm">see p. 257</span>); 
            that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal 
            tabernacles. (<span class="comm">Worldly possession are the Christian's stewardship. If he has 
                been wasting them in self-indulgence, he must take warning from the parable and 
                so employ them in deeds of 
                usefulness and mercy that, when the 
                stewardship is taken from him, he may have obtained for himself a refuge for 
                the future. But how can those whom the Christian has befriended receive him 
                into heaven? The key to the difficulty is found at (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 25: 35-40</span></span>), where our Lord altogether 
                identifies himself with his poor and unfortunate disciples, and returns on 
                their behalf a heavenly recompense for any kindness which has been shown them 
                on the earth. Only in this secondary and subordinate sense can those whom the 
                Christian has benefited receive him into heaven. Nor does the passage teach 
                that their is any merit in almsgiving, since the thing given is already 
                the property of another (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 16: 12</span></span>).  Almsgiving is only a phase of the fidelity required of a steward, and the 
                reward of a steward is not of merit but of grace <span class="style7">Luke 17: 7-10; Matthew 25: 21.</span></span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> He that is 
            faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous 
            in a very little is unrighteous also in much. (<span class="comm">God does not judge by the 
                magnitude of an act, but by the spiritual principles and motives which lie back 
                of the act. A small action may discover and lay bare these principles quite as 
                well as a large one. In the administration of small properties entrusted to us 
                on the earth we reveal our disposition and temper as stewards quite as well as 
                if we owned half the universe.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> If therefore ye have not been faithful in 
            the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? (<span class="comm">The word "unrighteous" is 
                here used to mean deceitful, as opposed to true. Worldly riches deceive us by 
                being temporal and transitory, while the true riches are 
                eternal <span class="style7">2 Corinthians 4: 18.</span></span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you 
            that which is your own? (<span class="comm">We are all God's stewards, and the perishing 
                possessions of earth are not our own (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Chronicles 29: 14</span></span>), but that which is given us forever is our 
                own (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 3: 22.</span></span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> No servant can serve two masters (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galatians 1: 10; James 4: 4</span></span>): for either he will hate the one, and love the 
            other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God 
            and mammon. (<span class="comm">See p. 257.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And the Pharisees, who 
            were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. 
            (<span class="comm">They derided him with open insolence (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 35</span></span>) This was a new phase of their opposition, and showed that they 
                no longer feared Jesus as formerly, being assured that he aimed at no earthly 
                dominion. Because of his poverty they may have regarded him as prejudiced 
                against wealth. At any rate, they regarded themselves as living contradictions 
                of this to them ridiculous statement that a man could not be rich and yet 
                religious.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves 
            in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: dor that which is exalted 
            among men is an abomination in the sight of God. (<span class="comm">The Pharisees lived in 
                such outward contrast to the publicans and made such pretensions and claims 
                that men esteemed them righteous, but they were none the less abominable in 
                God's sight. God approves righteousness when inward, but despises the 
                mere outward show of it.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the gospel 
            of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.
            (<span class="comm">See p. 283.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than 
            one tittle of the law to fall. (<span class="comm">See page 236. The law and the prophets had 
                been used of God to set up the old dispensation, and it had been so perverted 
                and abused that in it the Pharisees could pass for righteous men, though 
                abominable according to its true standard. Since the days of John the old 
                dispensation has been merging into the new, and this also has been subjected to 
                violence. But despite all the changes made, approved, and justified by men, the 
                God-given law had never changed. Its smallest letter could no more be 
                eliminated than the universe could be obliterated. But of course the Lawgiver 
                could with notice modify his law.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> Every one that putteth away his wife, 
            and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put 
            away from a husband committeth adultery. (<span class="comm">See p. 242. This precept is 
                inserted here as an illustration of a flagrant violation of the 
                law of God both countenanced and practiced by these Pharisees.</span>)</p>
