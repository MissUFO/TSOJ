        <h3>89. THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">OCTOBER, A.D. 29.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 7: 11-52.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and 
            said, Where is he? (<span class="comm">It was now eighteen months since Jesus had visited 
                Jerusalem, at which time he had healed the impotent man at Bethesda. His fame 
                and prolonged obscurity made his enemies anxious for him to again expose 
                himself in their midst. John here used the word "Jews" as a 
                designation for the Jerusalemites, who, as enemies of Christ, were to be 
                distinguished from the multitudes who were in doubt about him, and who are 
                mentioned in<span class="style7"> John 7: 12</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And 
            there was much murmuring 

            among the multitudes concerning 
            him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so; but he leadeth the 
            multitude astray. (<span class="comm">The use of the plural, "multitudes," 
                suggests that the vast crowd disputed as groups rather than individuals. The 
                inhabitants of some towns were disposed to unite in his defense, while those 
                from other towns would concur in condemning him.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> Yet no man spake openly 
            of him for fear of the Jews. (<span class="comm">They would not commit themselves upon a 
                question so important until the Sanhedrin had given its decision.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> But 
            when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and 
            taught. (<span class="comm">As the feast lasted eight days, the middle of it would be from the 
                third to the fifth day. Though Jesus had come up quietly to prevent public 
                demonstrations in his favor, he now taught boldly and openly in the very 
                stronghold of his enemies. His sudden appearance suggests the fulfillment of <span class="style7">Malachi 3: 1</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> The Jews therefore 
            marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? (<span class="comm">The 
                enemies of Christ were content to know but little about him, and now when they 
                heard him they could not restrain their astonishment at his wisdom. By letters 
                was meant the written law and the unwritten traditions which were taught in the 
                great theological schools at Jerusalem. The same word is translated 
                "learning" at <span class="style7">Acts 26: 24</span>. No one was expected to teach without having passed through such a course. 
                Skeptics of our day assert that Jesus derived his knowledge from the schools, 
                but the schoolteachers who are supposed to have taught him complained of him 
                that he was not their scholar, and surely they ought to have known.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that 
            sent me. (<span class="comm">Seeing the Jews inquiring as to the source of his wisdom, Jesus 
                explains that it was given him of God, and was therefore not derived from any 
                school.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the 
            teaching, whether it is of God, or whether
            I speak from myself. (<span class="comm">Those who would test the divinity of the 
                doctrine of Christ can not do so by rendering a 

                mere mechanical 
                obedience to his teaching. A willing, heartfelt obedience is essential to a 
                true knowledge of his doctrine. Such a disposition makes a good and honest 
                heart in which the seeds of his kingdom must inevitably grow. But a spirit of 
                disobedience is the general source of all skepticism.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> He that speaketh 
            from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that 
            sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. (<span class="comm">Those who 
                bear their own message seek their own glory. Those who bear God's message seek 
                God's glory, and such seeking destroys egotism.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Did not Moses give you 
            the law, and yet none of you 
            doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me? (<span class="comm">The point he makes here is, that 
                their seeking to kill him was proof that they were not keeping the law.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> The multitude answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill 
            thee? (<span class="comm">The multitude had sought to kill him at his last visit, and it now 
                affects to deny it. Wild notions and extraordinary conduct indicated insanity, 
                and insanity was usually attributed to demoniacal possession. Compare <span class="style7">Matthew 11: 18</span>. Their meaning therefore was that 
                the words of Jesus were insanely preposterous, and their words savored more of 
                roughness and irreverence than of malignant unkindness.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> Jesus answered 
            and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof. 
            (<span class="comm">Jesus forbears to speak further as to the plot to murder him, knowing that 
                time would reveal it; but refers to the miracle performed on the Sabbath day at 
                Bethesda eighteen months before, which gave rise to the plot to murder him. A 
                reference to the excitement at that time would recall to the thoughtful the 
                evidence and bitter hostility which the Jerusalemites had then manifested.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span>  Moses hath given you circumcision (<span class="comm">not that it is of Moses, but of the 
                fathers</span>); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> If a man 
            receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; 
            are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> Judge not 

            according to appearance, but judge 
            righteous judgment. (<span class="comm">The law which said that no work must be done on the 
                Sabbath day was in conflict with the law which said that a child must be 
                circumcised on the eighth day, whenever that eighth day happened to fall on the 
                Sabbath. It was a case of a specific command making exception to the 
                general law. Circumcision was great because it purified legally a portion of 
                the body. But the healing worked by Jesus was greater, for it renewed the whole 
                man. If the act of Christ in healing a man were judged as a mere act, it might 
                be considered a breach of the Sabbath. But if the nature of the act be taken 
                into account and all the laws relative to it be considered--in short, if 
                it be judged righteously in all bearings--it would be amply justified.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Some therefore of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to 
            kill?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto 
            him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ? (<span class="comm">Thus, 
                by referring to the miracle at Bethesda, Jesus not only brought to mind the 
                former opposition of the Jewish rulers, but he started the people of Jerusalem 
                (<span class="comm">who were acquainted with the present tempter of the hierarchy</span>) to talking 
                about the intention to kill him, thus warning the people beforehand that they 
                would be called upon to assist in his crucifixion. The men of Jerusalem spoke 
                more freely because the present boldness of Jesus led them to think that maybe 
                the rulers were changing their attitude toward him.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> Howbeit we know this 
            man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is. 
            (<span class="comm">Jerusalem shared the prejudice of its rulers: its citizens felt sure that the 
                rulers could not accept Jesus as Christ because his manner of coming did not 
                comply with accepted theories. Prophecy fixed upon Bethlehem as the birthplace 
                and the line of David as the family of the Christ, but the Jews, probably 
                influenced by <span class="style7">Isaiah 53: 8</span>, appear to 
                have held that there would be a mystery attached to the immediate and actual 
                parentage of the Messiah. Surely there could have been no greater mystery than 
                the real origin 

                of Jesus as he here outlines it to them, and as 
                they might have fully known it to be had they chosen to investigate the meaning 
                of his words.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye 
            both know me, and ye know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that 
            sent me is true, whom ye know not.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> I know him; because I am 
            from him, and he sent me. (<span class="comm">Our Lord here asserts their ignorance as to his 
                divine origin. Since he came from God, and they did not know God, they 
                consequently did not know whence he came. As they expected a Messiah who would 
                be supernaturally sent, they ought to have been satisfied with Jesus. But they 
                had no eyes with which to discern the supernatural.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> They sought 
            therefore to take him (<span class="comm">because they understood his language as referring to 
                God and were incensed that he should so openly declare them ignorant of God</span>)
            ; and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.
            (<span class="comm">Because it was not the will of God that he should be arrested at this time.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> But of the multitude believed on him; and they said, When the Christ 
            shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done? 
            (<span class="comm">Their question was an argument in favor of the Messiahship of Jesus.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and 
            the chief priests and the Pharisees (<span class="comm">that is, the Sanhedrin, described by 
                its constituent classes</span>) sent officers to take him. (<span class="comm">When the Sanhedrin 
                heard the people expressing their faith in Jesus they felt that it was time to 
                take action.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and 
            I go unto him that sent me. (<span class="comm">Knowing their attempt to arrest him, Jesus 
                tells them that it is not quite time for them to accomplish this purpose.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come. 
            (<span class="comm">They would soon destroy Jesus; after which they would seek him in vain. Their 
                violence would result in his return to his Father. In the dark days which were 
                about to come, the Jews would 

                long for a Messiah, for the Christ 
                whom they had failed to recognize in Jesus. They, too, would desire the 
                heavenly rest and security of a better world, but their lack of faith would 
                debar them from entering it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> The Jews therefore said among themselves, 
            Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the 
            Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> What is this 
            word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye 
            cannot come? (<span class="comm">The words of Jesus were plain enough, but the 
                assertion that he would return to God, and that such a return would be denied 
                to them was, in their ears, too preposterous to be entertained. They therefore 
                made light of it by construing it nonsensically. They asked if he would go 
                among the Jews who had been dispersed or scattered by the captivity and who had 
                never returned to Palestine, and if, when so doing, he would teach the heathen 
                among whom these dispersed were scattered, assuming that such teaching would 
                certainly frustrate and render absurd his claims to be a Jewish Messiah. They 
                little suspected that Jesus, through his apostles, would do this very thing and 
                thereby vindicate his claim as the true Messiah of God.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> Now on the last 
            day (<span class="comm">the eighth day</span>), the great 
            day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man 
            thirst, let him come unto me and drink. (<span class="comm">If we may trust the later Jewish 
                accounts, it was the custom during the first seven days for the priests and 
                people in joyful procession to go to the pool of Siloam with a golden pitcher 
                and bring water thence to pour out before the altar, in commemoration of the 
                water which Moses brought from the rock and which typified the Christ 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 10: 4</span></span>). If this is so, it is 
                likely that the words of Jesus have some reference to this libation, and are 
                designed to draw a contrast between the earthly water which ceases and the 
                spiritual water which abides, similar to the contrast which he presented to the 
                Samaritan woman at Jacob's well.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> He that believeth on me, as the 
            scripture hath said. (<span class="comm">in such passages as <span class="style7">Isaiah 58: 11; Zechariah 14: 8</span>, etc.</span>) from within him 
            shall flow rivers of living water. (<span class="comm">For comment on similar expressions see 
                page 145.</span>)
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span>  But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on 
            him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet 
            given; because Jesus was not yet glorified. (<span class="comm">The first and 
                second chapters of the Book of Acts is the best comment upon this passage. When 
                Jesus ascended to the right hand of the Father and was glorified, he sent forth 
                the Spirit upon his apostles on the day of Pentecost, and the apostles in turn 
                promised the gift of the Spirit to all who would believe, repent, and be 
                baptized.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> Some of the 
            multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the 
            prophet.
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, 
            doth the Christ come out of Galilee?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> Hath not the scripture 
            said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the 
            village where David was?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span> So there arose a division in the 
            multitude because of him. (<span class="comm">Some of the well disposed toward Jesus, seeing 
                the boldness with which he proclaimed himself, asserted that he was the prophet 
                spoken of by Moses (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 18: 15</span></span>), 
                which prophet was thought by some to be the Messiah himself, and by others to 
                be no more than the Messiah's forerunner. Still others of the multitude went 
                further and asserted that he was the Christ. These latter were confronted by 
                those who contended that Jesus was not born in the right place nor of the right 
                family. These did not know that he had satisfied the very objections which they 
                named.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on 
            him. (<span class="comm">We note here that the enmity of the rulers which had been taken up by 
                the men of Jerusalem (<span class="comm">see <span class="style7">John 7: 30</span></span>) had 
                now reached a faction even of the multitude, so that it desired his arrest, but 
                was restrained from acting.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> The officers therefore came to the chief 
            priests and Pharisees (<span class="comm">i. e., to those that had sent them</span>); 
            and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him? (<span class="comm">These officers were 
                temple police or Levites, under direction of the chief priests. The words 
                suggest 

                that the Sanhedrin was assembled and waiting for the 
                return of the officers. An extraordinary proceeding for so great a day, but no 
                more extraordinary than that assembly at the feast of the Passover which met 
                and condemned Jesus six months later.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> The officers answered, Never man 
            so spake. (<span class="comm">Their report has passed into a saying, which is as true now as 
                when first spoken.</span>)
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also 
            led astray?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the 
            Pharisees?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span>  But this multitude that knoweth not the law are 
            accursed. (<span class="comm">This rebuke to the officers may be paraphrased thus: You are to 
                respect the authority of the officers and the judgment of the Pharisees, but 
                you have permitted yourselves to be influenced by a multitude which rests under 
                a curse because of its ignorance.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span> Nicodemus said unto them (<span class="comm">he that came 
                to him before, being one of them</span>) (<span class="comm">therefore able to speak from a position 
                of equality</span>),
