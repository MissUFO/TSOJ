        <h3>99. JEWS ATTEMPT TO STONE JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM AND BEYOND JORDAN.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 10: 22-42.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And it was the feast of the dedication at 
            Jerusalem:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> it was winter; and Jesus walked in the temple in 
            Solomon's porch. (<span class="comm">The feast of dedication was one of eight days' duration 
                and began upon the 25th Chisleu, which, according to the calculation of M. 
                Chevannes, fell upon the nineteenth or twentieth of December, A.D. 29. The feast was kept in honor 
                of the renovation and purification of the temple in the year B.C. 164, after it had been desecrated 
                by the Syrians under Antiochus Epiphanes (<span class="comm">1 Macc. 1: 20-60; 4: 36-59; 2 Macc. 10: 1-8; Jos. Ant. 12: 7. 6, 7</span>). As this feast was 
                commemorative of national deliverance, the rulers considered it an opportune 
                time to tempt Jesus to declare himself to be the Messiah, or coming Deliverer 
                from the present Roman oppression. We are told that it was winter, that we may 
                understand why Jesus walked under cover in Solomon's porch. This was a 
                colonnade on the east side of the temple court, the name probably being derived 
                from the wall against which it was built, which Josephus tells us was the work 
                of Solomon--Jos. Ant. 20: 9. 7.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> The Jews therefore came round 


            about him (<span class="comm">as if to detain him until he answered</span>), 
            and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the 
            Christ, tell us plainly. (<span class="comm">The previous conduct and temper of the 
                questioners, together with the context (<span class="comm">which includes an attempt to stone, 
                    followed by an effort to arrest</span>), shows that this question was asked for the 
                purpose of committing Jesus to an open declaration which might be used as an 
                accusation against him.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe 
            not: the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me. 
            (<span class="comm">Jesus was the Christ of the Old Testament, but not the Christ of Pharisaic 
                hopes. Had he assumed to himself in their presence the title of Christ, 
                it would have led them to false expectations. By his declarations and works 
                Jesus had repeatedly published and proved to all his claims to be the true 
                Messiah. He had, at the feast of tabernacles, set himself forth as the Good 
                Shepherd, and on other occasions as the Son of God, etc. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 19; 8: 36, 56</span></span>). Had they understood or 
                received the Old Testament ideal of the Messiah, they could not have failed to 
                understand his claims.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my 
            sheep. (<span class="comm">Failure to be Christ's sheep was not the cause, but the evidence of 
                their unbelief.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow 
            me:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never 
            perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. (<span class="comm">The thought here is 
                similar to to that set forth on pp. 469, 470.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> My Father, who hath 
            given them me, is greater than 
            all; and no one is able to snatch them
            out of the Father's hand. (<span class="comm">This passage is taken by Calvinists 
                as asserting the doctrine of the impossibility of apostacy. It is certainly a 
                strong assurance that the Christian may expect to succeed in fighting the good 
                fight. It may be taken in connection with <span class="style7">Romans 8: 38-39</span>; but both passages must be interpreted in the light of <span class="style7">Hebrews 6: 4-8</span>. We can not be 
                taken from God against our will; but our will being free, we may choose to 
                leave him. We can not be 

                protected against ourselves in spite of 
                ourselves. If that were so, no one could be lost.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> I and the Father are 
            one. (<span class="comm">This assertion as to the unity of power residing in the hand brings 
                forward the idea of the general unity which subsists between the Father and the 
                Son. This unity Jesus asserts fully, without limitation or restriction; the 
                unity of interest, design, and essence are all included. It is the advance from 
                an assertion of special unity to an assertion of general unity.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> Then the 
            Jews took up stones again to stone him. (<span class="comm">They prepared to act on <span class="style7">Leviticus 24: 14-16</span>, and a precedent as to 
                it found at <span class="style7">1 Kings 21: 10</span>; though 
                the right to stone for blasphemy was now abrogated by the Roman dominion. The 
                repairs and enlargements then going on in the temple no doubt supplied an 
                abundance of missiles. The word "again" refers back to <span class="style7">John 8: 59</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Jesus answered them, Many 
            good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye 
            stone me?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we 
            stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest 
            thyself God. (<span class="comm">Jesus, conscious that he was living the divine life, 
                endeavored to arouse the Jews to a consciousness of that life by asking them to 
                point out what part of it offended them. It was a demand that his claim to be 
                divine be tested and judged by his life. But the Jews insisted upon 
                judging him by his words without in any way taking his life into 
                account. Jesus urged that a divine claim was made good by a divine life, but 
                they replied that a divine claim issuing from a human body was blasphemy.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 82: 6</span>. The whole Old Testament not 
                infrequently is thus designated as the "law"</span>), I said, Ye 
            are gods?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God 
            came (<span class="comm">and the scripture cannot be broken</span>),

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> say ye of him, whom 
            the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I 
            said, I am the Son of God? 
            (<span class="comm">Since the civil rulers of a land are ordained of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 13: 1-7; 1 Samuel 24: 6-7</span></span>), 

                they were regarded as God's delegates or ministers, and as such the inspired 
                Psalmist addresses them, calling them gods. Compare also <span class="style7">Exodus 22: 28</span>. If it was not blasphemy to call those gods who 
                so remotely represented the Deity, how much less did Christ blaspheme in taking 
                unto himself a title to which he had a better right than they, even in the 
                subordinate sense of being a mere messenger. The expression "word of 
                God" is equivalent to "commission from God." Compare <span class="style7">Luke 3: 2</span>, where John was commissioned. 
                The Jews regarded the Scripture as final authority. Jesus asserted this view by 
                stating that the Scripture could not be broken; that is, could not be undone or 
                set aside. We may regard Jesus as here ratifying their view, since he elsewhere 
                concurred in it--see <span class="style7">Matthew 5: 19</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> But 
            if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and 
            understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father. (<span class="comm">Having set aside 
                their false judgment which was based upon his mere words, Jesus again bids them 
                to consider his works or manner of life.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand. (<span class="comm">The calm reasoning of Jesus cooled their violence, and so far changed their evil designs that they now sought to arrest him that they might bring him before the Sanhedrin. The word &quot;again&quot; refers back to <span class="style7">John 7: 30, 32, 44</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the 
            place where John was at first baptizing; and there he abode. (<span class="comm">The word 
                "again" either refers to <span class="style7">John 1: 28</span>, or else it refers to some former escape beyond the Jordan not 
                recorded by John, but by one of the other evangelists. The supplementary nature 
                of John's Gospel makes this latter view somewhat plausible.</span>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> And many 
            came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things 
            whatsoever John spake of this man were true. (<span class="comm">John at first baptized 
                "in the wilderness of Jud&aelig;a" and afterwards at Bethany and 
                &aelig;non. The presence of Jesus in this place recalled to the 

                minds of the people the work of the Baptist and his testimony concerning Jesus. 
                They had held John to be a prophet, yet when they searched for his credentials 
                as a prophet, they found them inextricably intertwined with the claims of 
                Jesus. John had failed to prove himself a prophet by miracles and 
                signs--the accustomed credentials. But he had done so by his predictions 
                which had come true, and all of these predictions related to Jesus.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> And 
            many believed on him there. (<span class="comm">The word "there" stands in 
                contrast to Jerusalem, which rejected Jesus.</span>)
