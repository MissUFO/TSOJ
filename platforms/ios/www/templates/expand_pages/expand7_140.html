        <h3>140. JESUS BEFORE PILATE.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM. EARLY FRIDAY MORNING.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 27: 11-14; MARK 15: 2-5; <br>
            LUKE 23: 2-5;JOHN 18: 28-38.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 28</span> and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, 
            that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. (<span class="comm">See p. 641.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye 
            against this man?
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> They answered and said unto him, If this man 
            were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee. (<span class="comm">The 
                Jewish rulers first attempt to induce Pilate to accept their verdict and 
                condemn Jesus upon it, and execute him without a trial. If they had succeeded 
                in this, Jesus would have been put to death as a blasphemer. But as Pilate had 
                insisted upon trying Jesus, and as blasphemy was not a capital offense under 
                the Roman law, Jesus was condemned and executed as the King of the Jews.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according 
            to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to 
            death:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he 
            spake, signifying by what manner 

            of death he should die.
            (<span class="comm">As the Jews insisted on their own verdict, Pilate bade them pronounce their 
                own sentence, declining to mix jurisdictions by pronouncing a Roman sentence on 
                a Sanhedrin verdict. But the Jews responded that it is not in their power to 
                pronounce the sentence for which their verdict called, since they could not put 
                to death. Jesus could only be sentenced to death by the Roman court, and 
                crucifixion was the mode by which its death sentence was executed. Jesus had 
                predicted all this in the simple statement that he should die by crucifixion 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 12: 33-34</span></span>), but he also gave 
                the details of his trial--<span class="style7">Matthew 20: 18-19; Mark 10: 33-34</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 2</span> And they began to 
            accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to 
            give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king. (<span class="comm">The 
                Jews now profess to change their verdict into a charge, they themselves 
                becoming witnesses as to the truth of the matter charged. They say "We 
                found," thereby asserting that the things which they stated to Pilate 
                were the things for which they had condemned Jesus. Their assertion was utterly 
                false, for the three things which they now mentioned had formed no part 
                whatever of the evidence against Jesus in their trial of him. The first charge, 
                that Jesus was a perverter or seducer of the people, was extremely vague. The 
                second, that he taught to withhold tribute from C&aelig;sar, was a deliberate 
                falsehood. See p. 599. The third, that he claimed to be king, was true, but 
                this third charge, coupled with the other two, was intended to convey a sense 
                which was maliciously false. Jesus was a spiritual King, and claimed to be 
                such, and as such was no offender against the Roman government. But the rulers 
                intended that Pilate should regard him as claiming to be a political king, 
                which he had constantly refused to do--<span class="style7">John 6: 15</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 33</span> Pilate therefore entered 
            again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 11</span> Now Jesus stood before the governor (<span class="comm">Jesus is called from the 
                guards who have him in custody and stands alone before Pilate that the governor 
                may investigate his case privately</span>):

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 2</span> And 
            Pilate  the governor 

            asked him,
            and said unto him, {saying,} 
            Art thou the King of the Jews? (<span class="comm">The Gospels are unanimous in giving this 
                question as the first words addressed by Pilate to Jesus. The question 
                expresses surprise. There was nothing in the manner or attire of Jesus to 
                suggest a royal claimant. The question was designed to draw Jesus out should he 
                chance to be a fanatical or an unbalanced enthusiast.</span>) And Jesusanswering saith {answered him and 
            said,}  unto him, Thou sayest.  Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee 
            concerning me? (<span class="comm">Using the Hebrew form of affirmative reply (<span class="comm">see p. 698</span>), 
                Jesus admits that he is a king, but asks a question which forms the strongest 
                negation that he is a king in the sense contained in the Jewish accusation. Had 
                he been a king in that sense, Pilate would have been the one most likely to 
                know it. The question also, by an indirect query as to the accuser, reveals to 
                Pilate's mind that no Roman had accused him. He was accused of the Jews, and 
                when he had that restless, rebellious people ever found fault with a man who 
                sought to free them from the galling Roman yoke?</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 35</span> Pilate answered, Am I 
            a Jew? (<span class="comm">The strong, practical mind of the Roman at once caught the drift of 
                Christ's question, and perceived that the title "King of the Jews" 
                had in it a double meaning, so that it might be construed in some unpolitical 
                sense. What this sense was he could not tell, for he was not a Jew. The 
                mysteries of that nation were of no interest to him save where his office 
                compelled him to understand them.</span>) Thine own nation and the chief priests 
            delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? (<span class="comm">Pilate concedes that the 
                accusation against Jesus comes from an unexpected and suspicious source, and he 
                asks Jesus to tell him plainly by what means he had incurred the enmity of the 
                leaders of his people.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: 
            if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should 
            not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. (<span class="comm">Jesus 
                answers Pilate's question indirectly. He had done something to incur 

                the enmity of the rulers, and that was to have authority with and 
                exercise influence over the people (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 12: 19</span></span>). They objected to his kingly claims (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 21: 15-16; Luke 19: 38-39</span></span>), but Jesus shows Pilate 
                that these kingly claims, however distasteful to the Jews, were no offense to 
                or menace against the authority of Rome. Further than this, Jesus did not 
                define his kingdom, for Pilate had no concern in it beyond this. It was 
                sufficient to inform him that it made no use of physical power even for 
                purposes of defense. Such a kingdom could cause no trouble to Rome, and the 
                bare fact stated by Jesus proved that it was indeed such a kingdom.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou 
            sayest that I am a king. (<span class="comm">See p. 698.</span>) To this end have I been born, and 
            to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the 
            truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. (<span class="comm">Jesus here 
                enlightens Pilate as to the nature of his kingdom. He, the King, was the 
                incarnation of truth, and all those who derive the inspiration of their life 
                from truth were his subjects. For the purpose of thus bearing witness to and 
                revealing truth Jesus had been born, thus entering a new state of being, and he 
                had come into the world in this changed condition, thus entering a new sphere 
                of action. The words clearly imply the pre-existence of Christ and no doubt 
                aroused that state of uneasiness or fear which was increased by the words of 
                the Jewish rulers--<span class="style7">John 19: 7-8</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? (<span class="comm">This question has been 
                regarded as an earnest inquiry (<span class="comm">Chrysostom</span>), the inquiry of one who despaired 
                (<span class="comm">Olshausen</span>), a scoffing question (<span class="comm">Alford</span>), etc. But it is evident that Pilate 
                asked it intending to investigate the case of Jesus further, but, suddenly 
                concluding that he already knew enough to answer his purpose as a judge, he 
                stifles his curiosity as a human being and proceeds with the trial of Jesus, 
                leaving the question unanswered.</span>) And when he had said this, he went out 
            again unto the Jews, and saith unto them,  unto the 
            chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.  no crime in 

            him. (<span class="comm">The pronoun 
                "I" is emphatic; as if Pilate said, "You, prejudiced 
                fanatics, demand his death, but I, the calm judge, pronounce him 
                innocent."</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 3</span> And the chief priests accused 
            him of many things.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 12</span> And when he was 
            accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. (<span class="comm">When Pilate 
                left the Pr&aelig;torium to speak with the Jewish rulers, it is evident that 
                Jesus was led out with him, and so stood there in the presence of his 
                accusers.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> Then {<span class="style5">Mark 15: 4 </span>And} Pilate again asked him, {saith unto him,} saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of. Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 5</span> But they were the more urgent, saying, He 
            stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from 
            Galilee even unto this place. (<span class="comm">The Jews cling to their general accusation 
                of sedition, and seek to make the largeness of the territory where Jesus 
                operated overshadow and conceal the smallness of their testimony as to what his 
                operations were.</span>)
