        <h3>26. WOMAN AT THE WELL.</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 4: 5-42.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span>
            So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, 
            near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span>   
            and Jacob's well was there. (<span class="comm">Commentators long made the mistake of 
                supposing that Shechem, now called Nablous, was the town here called Sychar. 
                Sheckem lies a mile and a half west of Jacob's well, while the real Sychar, now 
                called 'Askar, lies scarcely half a mile north of the well. It was a small 
                town, loosely called a city, and adjoined the land which Jacob gave to Joseph 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 33: 19; 47: 22; Joshua 24: 32</span></span>), Joseph's tomb being about one hundred yards east of it. The 
                mummy of Joseph, carried out of Egypt at the time of the Exodus, was buried in 
                this parcel of ground, and there is but little doubt that it really rests in 
                the place indicated by the tomb; and though the name Sychar may be derived from 
                the words "liar" or "drunkard," it is more likely that 
                it means "town of the sepulchre," referring to this tomb. The Old 
                Testament is silent as to when or why Jacob dug this well. It lies on the 
                southern side of the valley of Shechem, where it opens upon 

                the 
                plain of Moreh (<span class="comm">now called el-Mukhnah</span>), about a hundred yards south of the foot 
                of Mt. Gerizim. It is one of the few Biblical sites about which there is no 
                dispute, and probably the only place on earth where one can draw a circle of a 
                few feet, and say confidently that the feet of Christ have stood within the 
                circumference. Maundrell, who visited it in 1697, said that it was 105 feet 
                deep, and had in it fifteen feet of water. But travelers have thrown stones 
                into it to sound its depth, until at present it is only sixty-six feet deep, 
                and has no water in it except in very wet winters. It is seven and half feet in 
                diameter, and is walled with masonry to a depth of about ten feet, below which 
                it is cut through the solid rock. It lies 400 nearly due south from Joseph's 
                tomb. As the neighborhood abounds in springs, the well would hardly have been 
                dug save by one who wished to be independent of his neighbors--as Jacob 
                did.</span>) Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the 
            well. (<span class="comm">John gives us important items as to the humanity of Jesus. He tells 
                us how he sat as a wayworn traveler, hungry and thirsty, at Jacob's well; and 
                he alone records the words, "I thirst," spoken on the cross 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 19: 28</span></span>). The top of the well is 
                arched over like a cistern, and a round opening is left about twenty inches in 
                diameter. On this arch or curbing Jesus sat. We should note the perpetuity of 
                blessings which springs from a good deed. Gutenberg did not foresee the 
                newspaper when he invented printing; Columbus did not anticipate the land of 
                the free when he led discoverers to our shore, nor is it likely that the 
                prophetic eye of Jacob ever saw the wearied Christ resting upon the well-curb 
                which he was building.</span>) It was about the sixth hour. (<span class="comm">That is, twelve 
                o'clock, if we reckon by Jewish time, or six o'clock in the evening, if we 
                reckon by the Roman method. We prefer the latter method.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span>   There cometh a 
            woman of Samaria to draw water (<span class="comm">She was not of the city of Samaria (<span class="comm">which 
                    was then called Sebaste--the Greek word for Augustus--in honor of 
                    Augustus C&aelig;sar, who had given it to Herod the Great</span>), but a woman of the 
                province of Samaria, which 

                lay between Jud&aelig;a and Galilee, 
                and reached from the Jordan on the east to the Mediterranean on the west, 
                comprising the country formerly occupied by the tribe of Ephraim and the half 
                tribe of Manasseh</span>): Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span>    For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food. (<span class="comm">Had the 
                disciples been present they would have bargained with the woman for the use of 
                her rope and pitcher; but in their absence Jesus himself asked her for a drink. 
                He met her on the ground of a common humanity, and conceded to her the power of 
                conferring a favor. Women have been immemorially the water-carriers in the East 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 24: 13, 14; Exodus 2: 16</span></span>). 
                Palestine is in summer a parched land, inducing intense thirst, and the people 
                usually comply cheerfully with the request for water; it was probably so in 
                Jesus' day (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10: 42</span></span>). Mohammed 
                commanded that water should never be refused.</span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span>   The Samaritan woman 
            therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew (<span class="comm">as his language 
                and dress declared</span>), askest drink of me, whom am a Samaritan woman? 
            (<span class="comm">For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span>) (<span class="comm">It is not likely that she 
                meant to refuse his request, but she yielded to the temptation to banter one 
                who she thought despised her, and whose necessities now caused him for a moment 
                to forget his pride. The ancestors of the Samaritans were introduced into the 
                land of Israel by the king of Assyria, after he led the ten tribes into 
                captivity (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Kings 17: 24-41</span></span>). When the Jews returned from their captivity in Babylon 
                and began to rebuild their temple, the Samaritans asked permission to build 
                with them, and when this was refused, an enmity arose between the two people 
                which never died out (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ezekiel 4: 1-5; Nehemiah 2: 10, 19; 4: 1-3</span></span>). We must, however, restrict the word 
                "dealings" to social intercourse. Race antipathy did not ordinarily 
                interfere with trade or other matters involving money, as is shown by verse 8 above. According to later tradition, a Jew accepted no hospitality from a Samaritan, and to eat his bread 
                as a guest was as polluting as to eat swine's flesh, but such social courtesy 
                was the very thing 

                which Jesus here asked. There are today 
                between one and two hundred Samaritans dwelling in Shechem at the foot of Mt. 
                Gerizim, and Dr. Robinson says of them that they "neither eat, nor drink, 
                nor marry with the Jews, but only trade with them."</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span>    Jesus answered 
            and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to 
            thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have 
            given thee living water. (<span class="comm">Jesus is himself the Gift of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 3: 16; 2 Corinthians 9: 15</span></span>). But she knew not 
                that God had bestowed a special Gift, and much less that the one to whom she 
                spoke was that Gift. Had she known she would have understood that though 
                physically Jesus was the object of her charity, spiritually their cases were 
                reversed, and she was the needy one, as Jesus intimates. Living water would 
                mean literally "running" or "spring water," as 
                contrasted with still or cistern water (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 26: 19; Leviticus 14: 5</span></span>). Jesus here uses it in the spiritual sense. He 
                fills us with his grace and truth (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 14</span></span>) and grants unto us continual, untold refreshing (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 7: 17</span></span>). The reviving and regenerating 
                effects of the Holy Spirit are likewise called living water (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 7: 37-39</span></span>).</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span>    The woman saith 
            unto him, Sir (<span class="comm">the word "Sir" is elsewhere translated 
                "Lord"</span>), thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is 
            deep: whence then hast thou that living water? (<span class="comm">She understood his words 
                literally, and was puzzled by them; but, won by the courtesy which suggested an 
                exchange of gifts, she answered respectfully, though incredulously.</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span>   Art 
            thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof 
            himself, and his sons, and his cattle? (<span class="comm">We should note three points in this 
                verse: 1. The greatness of Jesus. The woman had just called him 
                "Lord." The man at Bethesda, though he knew not Jesus, afterwards 
                did the same (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 7</span></span>). People felt 
                the majesty and dignity of Jesus. When he offered to give a greater blessing 
                than that given by Jacob, the woman at once contrasted him with 
                Jacob--Jacob with sons and cattle and wealth--and wondered if this 
                lonely 

                stranger could really imagine himself greater than the 
                illustrious patriarch. 2. She claimed descent from Jacob; it was a false claim. 
                Jesus classed the Samaritans with Gentiles (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10:5</span></span>), and spoke of them as strangers or aliens (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 17: 18</span></span>). 3. She spoke of the well as given 
                by Jacob. She meant that it had been given to Joseph (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 48: 22</span></span>), and that her people had inherited it as 
                descendants of Joseph.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span>    Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that 
            drinketh of this water shall thirst again: </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span>   but whosoever 
            drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst (<span class="comm">Jesus here 
                draws a contrast between earthly and heavenly blessings. No worldly joy gives 
                lasting satisfaction, but Jesus is the bread and water of life to his disciples 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 6: 35</span></span>) their unfailing 
                satisfaction</span>); but the water that I shall give him shall become in 
            him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. (<span class="comm">A beautiful figure of 
                the joy in Christ. In heat, in cold; in drought, in shower; in prosperity, in 
                adversity; it still springs up, cheering and refreshing the soul, and this unto 
                all eternity--<span class="style7">Revelation 7: 17; 21: 6.</span></span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>    The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, 
            neither come all the way hither to draw. (<span class="comm">She but dimly comprehended the 
                nature of Christ's offer, but was persuaded of two things: 1. The wonderful 
                water was to be desired. 2. Jesus was able and willing to give it. When she 
                spoke of coming "to draw" her words suggested the household to 
                which it was her duty to minister, and prepared the way for the command of 
                Jesus to bring the head of the household.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span>   Jesus saith unto her, Go, call 
            thy husband, and come hither. (<span class="comm">She had asked Jesus for the water of God's 
                grace, but she needed to be made conscious of how much she needed 
                it--conscious (<span class="comm">if we follow the figure</span>) of her dormant thirst. Jesus, 
                therefore, gave command to call her husband, that by so doing he might reveal 
                her life and waken her to repentance.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span>   The woman answered and said unto 
            him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no 
            husband: </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span>   for 

            thou hast had five husbands; 
            and he whom thou now has is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly. 
            (<span class="comm">The divine wisdom of Jesus brought to light a sad state of affairs. During the 
                period of five marriages the woman's life had at least some outward show of 
                respectability, but now it was professedly unclean. The number of marriages 
                reflects somewhat upon the character of the woman, and hints that some of them 
                may have been dissolved by her own fault, though the loose divorce law of that 
                age permitted a man to dissolve the marriage ties on very slight provocation. 
                Among the Jews the great Hillel is reported to have said that a man might 
                properly divorce his wife if she burnt his dinner while cooking. It is not 
                likely that any higher ideals of matrimony obtained among the Samaritans.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span>   The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. (<span class="comm">She 
                had heard of the miraculous knowledge of the Jewish prophets, and this evidence 
                given her by Jesus persuaded her that he was one of them, as a like evidence 
                had persuaded Nathanael (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 48, 49</span></span>). By thus calling him a prophet she virtually confessed the truth as to all 
                the things concerning which he had accused her.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span>   Our fathers worshipped 
            in this mountain (<span class="comm">i. e., Mt. Gerizim</span>); and ye (<span class="comm">ye 
                Jews</span>) say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
            (<span class="comm">Though a desire to divert the conversation from her own sins may have, in some 
                slight measure, prompted the woman to bring up this question about places of 
                worship, yet her main motive must have been far higher. If we ourselves stood 
                in the presence of one whom we felt assured to be fully inspired of God, how 
                hastily would we propound to him some of the vexed questions which befog the 
                religion of our time! Prompted by such a feeling, this woman sought to have the 
                great dispute between Jew and Samaritan decided. Solomon's temple in Jerusalem 
                was soon after its erection confronted by those who denied its claims to be 
                exclusively the place set apart for divine worship. Jeroboam, the rebellious 
                servant of Solomon, taught the people that Bethel and Dan were as acceptable 
                for worship as Jerusalem. But 

                Jerusalem, as the site of the first 
                great temple, held precedence above all rivals until its claims were 
                discredited in popular estimation by the fact that it was destroyed by 
                Nebuchadnezzar. When, after many years, the returning captives rebuilt its 
                walls, it lacked the sanction of age, and it had lost many of the features of 
                divine recognition, which contributed to the sacredness and grandeur of the 
                first structure. Soon after its erection in the days of Nehemiah, Manasseh, son 
                of the high priest Joiada, and brother of the high priest Jonathan (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Nehemiah 12: 10, 11; 13: 28</span></span>), married to the 
                daughter of Sanballat, Persian governor of Samaria. Refusing to dissolve this 
                marriage at the decree of the governor of Jerusalem, Manasseh was chased by 
                Nehemiah from Jerusalem, and his father-in-law made him high priest of the 
                Samaritans, and undertook to build for him the temple which afterwards crowned 
                the summit of Mt. Gerizim. Manasseh left Jerusalem about b.c. 332. The temple built for him was 
                destroyed by John Hyrcanus about b.c. 129, but the place where it stood was still the sacred center of 
                Samaritan worship, as it is to this day. Mt. Gerizim, and its supporting city 
                of Shechem, had many grounds on which to base their claims to be a sacred 
                locality: 1, Here God appeared to Abraham for the first time after his entering 
                Canaan (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 12: 6, 7</span></span>); 2, here Jacob 
                first dwelt (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 33: 18</span></span>); 3, here 
                Joseph came seeking his brethren (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 37: 12-13</span></span>); 4, here was a city of refuge (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Joshua 20: 7-9</span></span>); 5, here Joshua read the blessings and cursings 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Joshua 8: 33</span></span>); 6, here also he gave 
                his last address (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Joshua 24: 1</span></span>); 7, 
                here were buried the bones of Joseph (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Joshua 24: 32</span></span>), and the neighborhood was prominent at the time of the division 
                of the ten tribes (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 12: 1, 25</span></span>). If we may consider Samaritan traditions of that day as similar to those of the present, they had added greatly to the real importance of the neighborhood, for they now contend that 1, Paradise was on the summit of Gerizim; 2, Adam was formed of the dust of Gerizim; 3, on Gerizim Adam reared his first altar; 4, Seth here reared his first altar; 5, Gerizim was the Ararat on which the Ark rested, and the only spot which the flood did not overflow; and therefore the only place which escaped the defilement of dead bodies; 6, on it Noah reared his altar; 7, here Abraham attempted to offer Isaac; 8, here he met Melchizedek; 9, here was the real Bethel, where Jacob slept and saw his ladder vision. Backed by such high claims, the woman deemed it possible that this prophet might decide in favor of Samaria's holy place. We should note that the Samaritans worshiped in Mt. Gerizim because they could say, &quot;Our fathers did so.&quot; Thus many errors are perpetuated today because our fathers practiced them; but our fathers had no more authority to alter or amend God's word than we have. The Jews worshiped in Jerusalem because it had been prophesied that God would select a spot as the peculiar place for his worship (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 12: 5-11</span></span>), and because 
                according to this prophecy God had selected Mt. Moriah in

                was near at hand when all religious distinctions as to places would be 
                abolished, and when every spot might be used for purposes of

            from the Jews. (<span class="comm">Jesus here speaks as a Jew, and draws a comparison between 
                the intelligent worship of his people and the ignorant worship of the 
                Samaritans. Though the Samaritans possessed the Pentateuch, they were without 
                the revelation of God which the prophets of Israel had developed, and their 
                worship was neither authorized nor accredited by God. Moreover, it led toward 
                nothing; for salvation was evolved from the Jewish religion, and not from that 
                of Samaria. Salvation proceeded from the Jews. From them, according to the 
                flesh, Christ came, and from them came also the prophets, apostles, and 
                inspired writers who have given us that full knowledge of salvation which we 
                possess today. We must take the words of Jesus as referring rather to the two 
                religions than to the 

                two peoples. Though as a body the 
                Jews did not know whom they worshiped, and though their teachers were blind 
                leaders of the blind, yet the fault was in their unbelief, and not in the 
                revelation or religion in which they refused to believe. On the contrary, if 
                the Samaritans had believed his religion to the full, it would hardly have been 
                sufficient to have enabled him to know what he worshiped. Samaria was, in the 
                days of idolatry of Israel, a chief seat of Baal worship, and in later days it 
                was the home of magicians and sorcerers.</span>)   </p>

                i. e., those who render him the obedience of faith with a filial spirit,

                suggested to her the great Teacher who was to come, and caused her to yearn for 
                him who could tell, as she thought, perhaps even larger things. The Samaritans 
                justified their idea of a coming Benefactor by passages found in the 
                Pentateuch, and got their name for him from the Jews. Relying on the prophecy 
                found at <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 18: 18</span>, modern 
                Samaritans regard the Messiah as a returning Moses, calling him El-Mudy
                --the Guide. They contend that his name will begin with M, and that he 
                will live to be 120 years old. This woman's idea of the Messiah was probably 
                also very crude, but it was in part an improvement on the general Jewish 
                conception, for it regarded him as a teacher rather than a world-conquering,

                till the last year of his ministry. Jesus spoke more freely as to his office in

                effort to take him by force and make him a king (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 6: 15</span></span>); 2, his short stay in Samaria justified an explicit and

                for a long time previous, very low. Socrates thanked the gods daily that he was 
                born neither a slave nor a woman. Roman law gave the husband absolute authority 
                over the wife, even to put her to death; and Jewish contempt for women is made

                On second thought her statement is not so much of an exaggeration as it at 
                first appears. Her five marriages and present state covered the whole period of 
                her maturer life, and the way in which Jesus had disclosed it all convinced her

                the disciples looked abroad over its patches of varying green, they would say 
                that it would yet be four months before these patches could be harvested. The 
                harvests in the natural world are slow. But turning their eyes toward Sychar, 
                the disciples could see the citizens of the town in their white garments 
                pouring forth to see Jesus, and to be gathered by him as a harvest of disciples 
                which had sprung up and ripened from the seeds of truth sown by the woman but a 
                few moments before. Spiritual sowing brings speedy harvests. Some commentators 
                look upon the words of Jesus as proverbial, but there is no proverb extant 
                which places only four months between sowing and reaping. In Palestine this 
                period covers six months. We must, therefore, take the words of Jesus as a 
                plain statement as to the length of time between the date of his speaking and 
                the date of harvest. Harvest begins about the middle of April, and counting 
                back four months from that date we find that this visit to Sychar occurred 
                somewhere about the middle of December.</span>)  </p>

                into the heavenly garner. In this present the humble teacher sows and the 
                evangelist, or more gifted brother, reaps; but in that glad hour it shall 
                matter little whether we have been a sower or a reaper, for we shall all 
                rejoice together. Sower and reaper alike shall receive wages, a part of which 
                shall be the "fruit" gathered--the souls saved. Jesus regarded

                Later John the Baptist had wrought a mighty work toward this same end. Into a 
                field thus sown and cultivated Jesus was now leading his apostles, that they 
                might reap for him the ripened harvest. He bids them observe the speedy and 
                easy reaping on this occasion as an encouraging example to them, that they may 
                go forth with strong assurance and confidence. Even the minds of the Samaritans 
                were prepared to receive him, and a quick harvest could be gathered among 
                them.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span>   And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because 
            of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did. (<span class="comm">The Jews rejected the 
                testimony of the prophets and holy men of God as recorded in the Scripture 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 46, 47</span></span>), but the Samaritans 
                accepted the testimony of this woman, and she was a sinner.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span>   So when the

                city of Samaria (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 8: 5-8</span></span>).

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span>   and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not 
            because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is 
            indeed the Saviour of the world. (<span class="comm">Only such ready hearers could arrive at 
                so great a truth in so short a time. Wealth of revelation and blessing had made 
                the Jews selfish, and their conception of the Messiah was so perverted by this 
                selfishness that they could not conceive of him as being a world 
                Saviour. Thus wealth often dwarfs where it should rather enlarge the heart. The 
                incident comprised in this section presents the expansiveness of Christianity 
                in a threefold aspect; viz.: 1, we see it 

                breaking down the walls of racial prejudice; 2, we observe it elevating woman, and certifying her 
                fitness to receive the very highest spiritual instruction; 3, we behold it 
                lifting up the degraded and sinful, and supplying them from the fountains of 
                grace. Such is real Christianity--the Christianity of Christ.</span>)</p>
