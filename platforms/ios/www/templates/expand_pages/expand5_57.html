        <h3>57. JESUS' FEET ANOINTED.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 7: 36-50.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span>  And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would 
            eat with him. (<span class="comm">We learn from verse 40
                that the Pharisee's name was Simon. Because the feast at Bethany was given in 
                the house of Simon the leper, and because Jesus was anointed there also, some 
                have been led to think that Luke is here describing this supper. See <span class="style7">Matthew 26: 6-13; Mark 14: 3-9; John 12: 1-8</span>. But Simon the leper was not Simon the Pharisee. The name 
                Simon was one of the most common among the Jewish people. It was the Greek form 
                of the Hebrew Simeon. The New Testament mentions nine and Josephus twenty 
                Simons, and there must have been thousands of them in Palestine at that time. 
                The anointing at Bethany was therefore a different occasion from this.</span>) And 
            he entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. (<span class="comm">Literally, 
                reclined at meat. The old Jewish method of eating was to sit cross-legged on 
                the floor or on a divan, but the Persians, Greeks and Romans reclined on 
                couches, and the Jews, after the exile, borrowed this custom. We are not told 
                in plain terms why the Pharisee invited Jesus to eat with him. The envy and 
                cunning which characterized his sect leads us to be, perhaps, unduly suspicious 
                that his motives were evil. The narrative, however, shows that his motives were 
                somewhat akin to those of Nicodemus. He wished to investigate the character and 
                claims of Jesus, and was influenced more by curiosity than by 
                hostility--for 

                all Pharisees were not equally bitter 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 7: 45-52</span></span>). But he 
                desired to avoid in any way compromising himself, so he invited Jesus to his 
                house, but carefully omitted all the ordinary courtesies and attentions which 
                would have been paid to an honored guest. Jesus accepted the invitation, for it 
                was his custom to dine both with Pharisees and publicans, that he might reach 
                all classes.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span>   And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when 
            she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's house, she brought an 
            alabaster cruse of ointment. (<span class="comm">Because the definite article 
                "the" is used before the word "city," Meyer says it was 
                Capernaum, and because Nain is the last city mentioned, Wiesler says it was 
                Nain, but it is not certain what city it was. Older commentators say it was 
                Magdala, because they hold the unwarranted medieval tradition that the sinner 
                was Mary Magdalene, i. e., Mary of Magdala. No trustworthy source has 
                ever been found for this tradition, and there are two good reasons for saying 
                that this was not Mary Magdalene: 1. She is introduced soon after (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 8: 2</span></span>) as a new character and also as a 
                woman of wealth and consequence. See also <span class="style7">Matthew 27: 55</span>. 2. Jesus had delivered her from the possession of seven 
                demons. But there is no connection between sin and demon-possession. The former 
                implies a disregard for the accepted rules of religious conduct, while the 
                latter implies no sinfulness at all. This affliction was never spoken of as a 
                reproach, but only as a misfortune. The cruse which she brought with her was 
                called "an alabaster." Orientals are very fond of ointments and use 
                them upon the face and hair with profusion. They were scented with 
                sweet-smelling vegetable essence, especially that extracted from the myrtle. 
                Originally the small vases, jars or broad-mouthed bottles, in which the 
                ointment was stored, were carved from alabaster, a variety of gypsum, white, 
                semi-transparent and costly. Afterwards other material was used, but the name 
                "alabaster" was still applied to such cruses. That used by Mary of 
                Bethany was probably the highest grade ointment in the highest priced cruse 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 12: 3</span></span>). The context here 

                leaves us free to suppose that both the cruse and the unguent were of 
                a cheaper kind</span>), 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span>   and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she 
            began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, 
            and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. (<span class="comm">To see this 
                scene we must picture Jesus stretched upon the couch and reclining on his left 
                elbow. The woman stood at the foot of the couch behind his feet. His feet were 
                bare; for every guest on entering left his sandals outside the door. The woman, 
                feeling strongly the contrast between the sinlessness of Jesus and her own 
                stained life, could not control her emotions. "The tears," says 
                Brom, "poured down in a flood upon his naked feet, as she bent down to 
                kiss them; and deeming them rather fouled than washed by this, she hastened to 
                wipe them off with the only towel she had, the long tresses of her own hair. 
                She thus placed her glory at his feet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 11: 15</span></span>), after which she put the ointment upon them."</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span>   Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, 
            saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what 
            manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner. (<span class="comm">Public 
                opinion said that Jesus was a prophet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 7: 16</span></span>), and Simon, from the Pharisee's standpoint, feared that it might 
                be so; and therefore no doubt felt great satisfaction in obtaining this 
                evidence which he accepted as disproving the claims of Jesus. He judged that if 
                Jesus had been a prophet he would have both known and repelled this woman. He 
                would have known her because discerning of spirits was part of the prophetic 
                office--especially the Messianic office (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 11: 2-4; 1 Kings 14: 6; 2 Kings 1: 1-3; 5: 26</span></span>). Compare<span class="style7">  John 2: 25</span>. He would have 
                repelled her because, according to the Pharisaic tradition, her very touch 
                would have rendered him unclean. The Pharisees, according to later Jewish 
                writings, forbade women to stand nearer to them than four cubits, despite the 
                warning of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 65: 5</span></span>). Thus 
                reasoning, Simon concluded that Jesus had neither the knowledge nor the 
                holiness which are essential to a prophet. His narrow mind did not 

                grasp the truth that it was as wonderful condescension for Christ to sit at his 
                board as it was to permit this sinner to touch him.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span>   And Jesus answering 
            said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Teacher, 
            say on. (<span class="comm">Jesus heard Simon's thoughts and answered them. Simon called Jesus 
                "Teacher," little thinking how fully Jesus was about to vindicate 
                the justice of the title, thus given him in compliment.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span>   A certain lender 
            had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty. 
            (<span class="comm">The denarius or shilling was a silver coin issued by Rome which contained 
                nearly seventeen cents' worth of that precious metal. The two debts, therefore, 
                represented respectively about seventy-five dollars, and seven dollars and 
                fifty cents. But at that time a denarius was a day's wages for a laboring man 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 20: 2, 4, 12, 13</span></span>), so that the 
                debt is properly translated into our language as if one owed five hundred and 
                the other fifty days of labor.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span>   When they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. 
            (<span class="comm">In this brief parable God represents the lender, and the woman the big and 
                Simon the little debtor. Simon was (<span class="comm">in his own estimation</span>) ten times better off 
                than the woman; yet they were each in an equally hopeless case--having 
                nothing with which to pay; and each in an equally favored case--being 
                offered God's free forgiveness. Forgiveness is expressed in the past tense in 
                the parable, but merely as part of the drapery and not for the purpose of 
                declaring Simon's forgiveness. It indicates no more than that Jesus was equally 
                willing to forgive both. But the Pharisee did not seek his forgiveness, 
                and the absence of all love in him proved that he did not have it.</span>) Which of 
            them therefore will love him most? (<span class="comm">It was Jesus' custom to thus often draw 
                his verdicts from the very lips of the parties concerned--<span class="style7">Luke 10: 36, 37; Matt. 21: 40, 41.</span></span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span>   Simon 
            answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. (<span class="comm">The 
                "suppose" of Simon betrays a touch of supercilious irony, showing 
                that the Pharisee thought the question very trivial. And he said unto him, 
                Thou hast rightly judged. (<span class="comm">Simon's words were more 

                    than an 
                    answer. They were a judgment as well. Like Nathan with David (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Samuel 12: 1-7</span></span>), Jesus had concealed 
                    Simon's conduct under the vestments of a parable, and had thus led him to 
                    unwittingly pronounce sentence against himself. Simon, the little debtor, was a 
                    debtor still; having no acts of gratitude to plead in evidence of his 
                    acquittal. From this point the words of Jesus take up the conduct of Simon 
                    which we should here picture to ourselves. "We must imagine the guests 
                    arriving; Simon receiving them with all courtesy, and embracing each in turn; 
                    slaves ready to was the dust of the road from their sandaled feet, and to pour 
                    sweet olive oil over their heads to soften the parched skin. See <span class="style7">Genesis 18: 4; 19: 2; 24: 32; Ruth 3: 3; 1 Samuel 25: 
                        41; Psalms 23: 5; 141: 5; Ecclesiastes 9: 8; Daniel 10: 3; Amos 6: 6; Matthew 6: 17</span>. But there is one of the guests 
                    not thus treated. He is but a poor man, invited as an act of condescending 
                    patronage. No kiss is offered him; no slave waits upon him; of course a 
                    mechanic can not need the luxuries others are accustomed to!"</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span>   And 
            turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? (<span class="comm">Simon is 
                to look upon the woman as one whose actions stood in contrast to his own.</span>) I 
            entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath 
            wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. (<span class="comm">Jesus here 
                draws the first contrast. In the East, where the feet without stockings are 
                placed in sandals instead of shoes, water becomes essential to one who would 
                enter a house. The guest should be afforded an opportunity to wash the dust 
                from his feet, not only for comfort's sake, but also that he might not be 
                humiliated by soiling the carpets on which he walked, and the cushions on which 
                he reclined. The trifling courtesy Simon had omitted; but the woman had amply 
                supplied his omission, bathing the Lord's feet in what Bengel well calls 
                "the most priceless of waters."</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span>   Thou gavest me no kiss: but 
            she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. (<span class="comm">We have 
                here the second contrast. A kiss was the ordinary salutation of respect in the 
                East. Sometimes the hand was 

                kissed, and sometimes the cheek 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Samuel 15: 5; 19: 39; Matthew 26: 49; Acts 20: 37; Romans 16: 16</span></span>). We may note incidentally that we have no record 
                of a kiss upon the cheek of Jesus save that given by Judas. The woman had 
                graced the feet of Jesus with those honors which Simon had withheld from his 
                cheek.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span>   My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my 
            feet with ointment. (<span class="comm">Anointing was a mark of honor which was usually 
                bestowed upon distinguished guests (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Amos 6: 6; Psalms 23: 5; 141: 5</span></span>). To anoint the feet was regarded as extreme 
                luxury (<span class="comm">Pliny H.N. 13: 4</span>). In this third case Jesus makes a double 
                comparison. To anoint the feet was more honored than to anoint the head, and 
                the ointment was a more valuable and worthy offering than the mere oil which 
                ordinary courtesy would have proffered.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span>   Wherefore I say unto thee, Her 
            sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is 
            forgiven, the same loveth 
            little. (<span class="comm">Her love was the result, and not the cause, of her forgiveness. 
                Our sins are not forgiven because we love God, but we love God because they are 
                forgiven (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 4: 19</span></span>). Such is the 
                inference of the parable, and such the teaching of the entire New Testament. We 
                search the story in vain for any token of love on the part of Simon.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span>   And 
            he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span>   And they that sat at 
            meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth 
            sins? (<span class="comm">They were naturally surprised at this marvelous assumption of 
                authority, but in the light of what had just been said they did not dare to 
                express themselves. Ignorance of Christ's person and office caused them to thus 
                question him. It is easy to stumble in the dark. We are not told that Simon 
                joined in asking this question.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span>   And he said unto the woman, Thy faith 
            hath saved thee; go in peace. (<span class="comm">Jesus did not rebuke his questioners, 
                because the process of forgiveness was something which could not be 
                demonstrated to their comprehension, and hence their error could not be made 
                clear. Jesus attributed her forgiveness to her faith. "Peace" was 
                the Hebrew and "grace" 

                was the Greek salutation. It is 
                here used as a farewell, and means "Go in the abiding enjoyment of 
                peace." Several valuable lessons are taught by this incident. 1. That the 
                sense of guiltiness may differ in degree, but nevertheless the absolute 
                inability of man to atone for sin is common to all. 2. As sin is against 
                Christ, to Christ belongs the right and power to forgive it. 3. That 
                conventional respectability, having no such flagrant and open sins as are 
                condemned by the public, is not conscious of its awful need. 4. That those who 
                have wandered far enough to have felt the world's censure realize most fully 
                the goodness of God in pardoning them, and hence are moved to greater 
                expressions of gratitude than are given by the self-righteous. But we must not 
                draw the conclusion that sin produces love, or that much sin produces much 
                love, and that therefore much sin is a good thing. The blessing which we seek 
                is not proportioned to the quantity of the sins; but is proportioned to the 
                quantity of sinful sense which we feel. We all have sin enough to 
                destroy our souls, but many of us fail to love God as we should, through an 
                insufficient sense of sinfulness.</span>)
