        <h3>45. DUTIES OF MESSIAH'S SUBJECTS.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 5: 13-16.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the 
            salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good 
            for nothing, but to be cast out and be trodden under foot of men. (<span class="comm">Salt has 
                been used from time immemorial as an agent in the preservation of meats. The 
                multitudes which heard Jesus were familiar with its use in curing fish. 
                "The pickled fish of Galilee were known throughout the Roman world" 
                (<span class="comm">G. A. Smith</span>). It is worthy of note that the salt of Palestine gathered 
                from the marshes is not pure. Because of the foreign substances in it, it loses 
                its savor and becomes insipid and useless, when exposed to the sun and air, or 
                when permitted for any considerable time to come in contact with the ground; 
                but pure salt does not lose its savor. The verse teaches that God's people keep 
                the world from putrefaction and corruption. There was not salt enough in the 
                antediluvian world to save it from the flood, in Sodom to save it from fire, 
                nor in Canaan to preserve its people from destruction. It also teaches--as 
                does experience--that a disciple may lose those qualities which make him 
                salt.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be 
            hid. (<span class="comm">As light dispels darkness and enables a man to see his way, so the 
                Christian, by his teaching and example, removes ignorance and prejudice, and 
                discloses the way of life. The church, reflecting the light of Christ, is of 
                necessity a conspicuous body, so that neither its blemishes nor its beauty can 
                be concealed. For air and for 

                protection cities were frequently 
                built upon hills. Jerusalem and Samaria were both hill cities.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel (<span class="comm">a common measure, found in every Jewish house, and containing about a peck</span>), but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house. (<span class="comm">Lamps were then crude affairs without chimneys, in which, for the most part, olive oil was burned. Candles were not then known. The word candle, where used in the King James version, is a mistranslation.</span>) 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. (<span class="comm">The light of the Christian is to shine not ostentatiously, but naturally and unavoidably. It is to shine not only in his teaching or profession, but in such works and actions as unprejudiced men must acknowledge to be real excellencies. Moreover, it must so shine that it shall not win praise for itself, but for him who kindled it. Men do not praise the street lamps which protect them from robbery and assault, but they praise the municipal administration which furnishes the lamps.</span>) </p>
