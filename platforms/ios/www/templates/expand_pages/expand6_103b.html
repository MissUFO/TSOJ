        <h3>103B. SECOND GROUP OF PARABLES</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY IN PER&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>THE LOST SHEEP</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 15: 3-7.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And he spake unto them this parable (<span class="comm">Jesus had 
                spoken this parable before. See pp. 434, 435.</span>) saying,</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> What 
            man of you (<span class="comm">man is emphatic; it is made so to convey the meaning that if 
                man would so act, how much more would God so act</span>), having an hundred 
            sheep (<span class="comm">a large flock</span>), and having lost one of them, doth not 
            leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness (<span class="comm">the place of pasture, and 
                hence the proper place to leave them</span>), and go after that which is 
            lost, until he find it? (<span class="comm">The ninety-nine represent the Jewish 
                respectability, and the lost sheep stands for a soul which has departed from 
                that respectability.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his 
            shoulders, rejoicing. (<span class="comm">A touch suggesting the weakness of the sheep and the 
                willing affection of the shepherd.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 12: 2</span></span>), for I have 
            found my sheep which was lost. (<span class="comm">The call implies that the loss was known to 
                the neighbors, and that they felt concerned about it. Had the Pharisees been 
                neighbors to the spirit of Christ, they would have sympathized with him in his 
                joy; but they were false undershepherds  <span class="style7">Ezekiel 34.</span></span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span>  I say unto you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, 
            more than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no 
            repentance. (<span class="comm">How little Jesus thought of external morality may be seen by 
                his words at <span class="style7">Luke 18: 9,</span> but he here quoted the Pharisees at their own valuation to show that even when 
                so doing, God's love for the sinner was the paramount love.</span>)</p>
