        <h3>11. FLIGHT INTO EGYPT.</h3>
        <h3>(BETHLEHEM AND ROAD THENCE TO EGYPT, B.C. 4.)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 2: 13-18.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span>     Now when they were departed (<span class="comm">The text favors 
                the idea that the arrival and departure of the magi and the departure of Joseph 
                for Egypt, all occurred in one night. If so, the people of Bethlehem knew 
                nothing of these matters</span>), behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to 
            Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise (<span class="comm">this command calls for immediate 
                departure</span>) and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt 
            (<span class="comm">This land was ever the refuge of Israel when fleeing from famine and 
                oppression. One hundred miles in a direct line from Bethlehem would carry 
                Joseph well over the border of Egypt. Two hundred miles would bring him to the 
                river Nile. In Egypt he would find friends, possibly acquaintances. There were 
                at that time about one million Jews in the Nile valley. In Alexandria, a city 
                of 300,000, from one-fifth to two-fifths of the population were Jews, two of 
                the five wards being given over to them; and the Talmud describes how, in its 
                great synagogue, all the men of like craft or trade sat together. Thus Joseph 
                might there find fellow-craftsmen, as did Paul in Corinth-- <span class="style7">Acts 18: 3</span></span>), and be thou there until 
            I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. (<span class="comm">Thus joy 
                at the honor of the magi's visit and worship gives place to terror at the wrath 
                of Herod. The quiet days at Bethlehem are followed by a night of fear and 
                flight. The parents of Jesus were experiencing those conflicting joys and 
                sorrows which characterize the lives of all who have to do with Christ--
                <span class="style7">Mark 10: 30; 2 Timothy 3: 12.</span></span>)   </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span>     And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, 
            and departed into Egypt (<span class="comm">What a criticism upon Israel when Egypt, the house 
                of bondage, the seat of tyranny, the land of the immemorial enemies of God's 
                people, was regarded as a place of refuge from its ruler. Jesus was saved by 
                flight. God invariably prefers the ordinary to the extraordinary means</span>);  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>     and was there until the death of Herod (<span class="comm">as Herod died soon after the 
                flight to Egypt, the sojourn of the family of Jesus in that land must have been 
                brief, for they returned after his death</span>): that it might be fulfilled 
            which was spoken by the Lord (<span class="comm">the message is the Lord's, the words and 
                voice are the prophet's</span>) through the prophet (<span class="comm">see  <span class="style7">Hosea 11: 1</span></span>), saying, Out of Egypt did I call my 
            son. (<span class="comm">This prophecy, no doubt, had a primary reference to the Exodus, and 
                was an echo of the words of Moses at  <span class="style7">Exodus 4: 22, 
                    23</span>. In their type and antitype relationship the Old and New 
                Testaments may be likened to the shell and kernel of a nut. Israel was Israel, 
                and God's Son, because it included in itself the yet unformed and unborn body 
                which was later to be inhabited by the spirit of the Word or Son of God. The 
                seed of Abraham was called out of Egypt, that the promised seed enveloped 
                within it might have a body and nature prepared in the land of liberty, and not 
                in that of bondage. Israel was the outer shell, and Christ the kernel, hence 
                the double significance of the prophecy--the twice repeated movement of 
                the nation and the Man.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked (<span class="comm">the magi, no doubt, intended to return to Herod, and would have done so but for the dream, but when they failed to return, they seemed to Herod to have taken pleasure in deceiving him, and the very honesty of their conduct passed for the lowest depth of cunning</span>) of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth (<span class="comm">wroth at being made sport of, and doubly wroth because of the serious matter as to which they presumed to jest</span>), and sent forth (<span class="comm">murderers, suddenly</span>), and slew (<span class="comm">Thus early did persecution attend those associated with Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10: 24, 25</span></span>). This brutality was in keeping with Herod's character. Jealousy as to his authority led him to murder two high priests, his uncle Joseph, his wife, and three of his own sons, besides many other innocent persons. Fearing lest the people should rejoice at his departure, he summoned the leading citizens of all the cities of his realm, and, shutting them up in the circus grounds at Jericho, ordered his sister Salome and her husband to have them all put to death at the moment when he died, that the land might mourn at his death</span>) all the male children that were in Bethlehem (<span class="comm">As Bethlehem was not a large place, the number of martyrs could not have been large. It is variously estimated that from twelve to fifty were slain. Had the parents of Bethlehem known that Jesus was on the way to Egypt, they might have saved their own children by giving information as to the whereabouts of the right child; that is, if we may assume that they were being butchered</span>), and in all the borders (<span class="comm">Adjacent places; settlements or houses around Bethlehem. The present population of the town is fully five thousand; it was probably even larger in Christ's time</span>) thereof, from two years old and under (<span class="comm">According to Jewish reckoning this would mean all children from birth up to between twelve and thirteen months old, all past one year old being counted as two years old</span>), according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise-men. (<span class="comm">That is, he used their date as a basis for his calculations. It is likely that six months had elapsed since the star appeared, and that Herod doubled the months to make doubly sure of destroying the rival claimant. Not knowing whether the child was born before or after the appearing of the star, he included all the children of that full year in which the star came.</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> Then was fulfilled (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 2: 6, 15, and 18</span> give us three different kinds of prophecy. The first is direct, and relates wholly to an event which was yet future; the second is a case where an act described is symbolic of another later and larger act; the last is a case where words describing one act may be taken as fitly and vividly describing another later act, though the acts themselves may bear small resemblance. Matthew does not mean that Jeremiah predicted the slaughter at Bethlehem; but that his words, though spoken as to another occasion, were so chosen of the Spirit that they might be fitly applied to this latter occasion</span>) that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 31: 15</span></span>), saying,
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span>    A voice was heard in Ramah (<span class="comm">This word means 
                "highland" or "hill." The town lies six miles north of 
                Jerusalem. It was the birthplace and burial-place of the prophet Samuel. It is 
                also supposed to be the Aramathea of the New Testament. See  <span class="style7">Matthew 27: 57</span></span>), Weeping and great 
            mourning, Rachel weeping for her children (<span class="comm">Why these tearful mothers in 
                Bethlehem? Because that which Christ escaped remained for his brethren, their 
                children, to suffer. If he would escape death, all his brethren must die. But 
                he died that all his brethren might live</span>); And she would not be 
            comforted, because they are not. (<span class="comm">The words here quoted were originally 
                written concerning the Babylonian captivity (<span class="comm"> <span class="style7">Jeremiah 31: 15</span></span>). Ramah was a town of Benjamin (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Joshua 18: 25</span></span>). Jeremiah was carried thither in chains with the other captives, but was there released by the order of Nebuchadnezzar (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 40: 1; 39: 11, 12</span></span>). Here he saw the captives depart for Babylon, and heard the weeping of the poor who were left in the land (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jeremiah 39: 10</span></span>); hence the mention of Ramah as the place of lamentation. He represents Rachel weeping, because the Benjamites were descendants of Rachel, and, perhaps, because the tomb of Rachel was &quot;in the border of Benjamin,&quot; and not far away (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Samuel 10: 2</span></span>). The image of the 
                ancient mother of the tribe, rising from her tomb to weep, and refusing to be 
                comforted because her children were not around her, is inimitably beautiful; 
                and this image so strikingly portrayed the weeping in Bethlehem that Matthew 
                adopts the words of the prophet, and says that they were here fulfilled. It was 
                the fulfillment, not of a prediction, properly speaking, but of certain 
                words spoken by the prophet.</span>)  </p>
