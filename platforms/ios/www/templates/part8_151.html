                    <h1>Seventh Appearance of Jesus</h1>

                    <p>After this, Jesus appeared to them again at the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('seaofgalilee')">sea of Tiberias</a>.</p>

                    <p>Peter had decided to go fishing and the other <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">disciples</a> followed along. They went into a boat and fished all night, but caught nothing.</p>

                    <p>When the morning came, they saw a man standing on the beach. The disciples did not immediately recognize that it was Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>Children do you have anything to eat?</p>

                    <p>They answered:</p>

                    <p>No.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>Cast your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.</p>


                    <img src="img/tiberius.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="tiberius" title="tiberius" />
                    <p>They did as Jesus said and the nets were so full that they could not lift them into the boat.</p>

                    <p>John said to Peter:</p>

                    <p>It is the Lord!</p>

                    <p>When Peter knew it was Jesus, he wrapped his coat around himself and jumped from the boat and swam for shore.</p>

                    <p>The other disciples stayed in the boat and made their way to shore dragging the nets full of fish.</p>

                    <p>When they got to land they saw that Jesus had started a fire and the coals were burning, and fish was cooking and there was bread.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>Bring some of the fish you have caught.</p>

                    <p>Peter pulled the nets full of fish onto the shore. They had caught one hundred and fifty three large fish, but the nets had not broken.</p>

                    <img src="img/modernfish.png" class="img-responsive" name="modernfish" title="modernfish" />
                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>Come and have breakfast.</p>

                    <p>Jesus gave them bread and fish.</p>

                    <p>This was the third time Jesus appeared to the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">disciples</a> after he had risen from the dead.</p>

                    <p>After eating breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter:</p>

                    <p>Simon, son of John, do you love me better than fishing?</p>

                    <p>He answered:</p>

                    <p>You know that I love you.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to him:</p>

                    <p>Feed my lambs.</p>

                    <p>Again the second time, Jesus asked Peter:</p>

                    <p>Peter do you love me more than this fishing business?</p>

                    <p>Peter answered:</p>

                    <p>Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.</p>

                    <p>Then Jesus said to him:</p>

                    <p>Take care of my sheep.</p>

                    <p>Then Jesus said to Peter the third time:</p>

                    <p>Peter, son of John, Do you love me?</p>

                    <p>Peter replied:</p>

                    <p>Lord you know all things, you know that I love you.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to him:</p>

                    <p>Feed my sheep.</p>

                    <p>Truly, truly I tell you, when you were young, you walked where you wanted to walk. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will carry you where you do not want to go.</p>

                    <p>Jesus was telling Peter ahead of time how his death would glorify God.</p>

                    <p>And after Jesus said this, he said to Peter:</p>

                    <p>Follow me.</p>

                    <p>Peter, turning around and seeing John, asked Jesus:</p>

                    <p>And what will happen to John?</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to Peter:</p>

                    <p>If I willed that John live until I come again, what business is that of yours?</p>

                    <p>Even though Jesus did not say that John would not die, the rumor got started among the other disciples that he would not die.</p>

                    <p>There are many other things that Jesus did, which if they should all be written would fill the world with books. </p>
