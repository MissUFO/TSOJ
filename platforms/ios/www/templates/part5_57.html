                    <h1>Jesus' Feet Anointed </h1>

                    <p>One of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> invited Jesus to his home. Jesus accepted and went to the Pharisee's home to eat a meal with him.</p>

                    <p>A woman who was known as a sinner found out that Jesus was in the house.</p>

                    <p>She entered the house carrying an alabaster bottle of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('perfumedoil')">ointment perfume</a>. She went to the end of the couch that Jesus was reclining on and stood weeping so that her tears wet Jesus feet.</p>

                    <p>She then began to wipe Jesus feet with her hair, <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('anointfeet')">kissed his feet</a> and anointed them with the perfumed oil.</p>

                    <p>The Pharisee said to himself:</p>

                    <p>If this man were a <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('prophesied')">prophet</a> he would have known that this is a sinful woman and would not allow her to touch him.</p>

                    <p>Jesus knew what his host was thinking said:</p>

                    <p>Simon ( that was the Pharisee's name), I have something to say to you.</p>

                    <p>Simon  said:</p>

                    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('teacher')">Teacher</a>, tell me what is on your mind.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>A lender had two debtors: One owed him 500 shillings and the other owed him 50. Neither of the debtors was able to pay the lender back, so he forgave both debts. Now let me ask you a question: Which of the debtors will love the lender the most?</p>

                    <p>Simon answered:</p>

                    <p>I suppose the one who was forgiven the most.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>You have given the right answer.</p>

                    <p>Turning to the woman, he said to Simon:</p>

                    <p>Do you see this woman? I came into your house and you gave me no water to wash my feet, but she has wetted my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</p>

                    <p>You did not give me a greeting kiss; but she, since the time I came into your house, has not stopped kissing my feet.</p>

                    <p>You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</p>

                    <p>I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven because she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, little love is shown.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to the woman:</p>

                    <p>Your sins are forgiven.</p>

                    <p>Those who were at the table with Jesus began to say to each other:</p>

                    <p>Who does he think he is, that he can forgive sins?</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to the woman:</p>

                    <p>Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.</p>
