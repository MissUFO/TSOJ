                    <h1>Messianic Teaching</h1>
                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I did not come to destroy, I came to fulfill.</p>

                    <p>I tell you an important truth, Until heaven and earth pass away, not one small stroke of the pen, or the smallest letter in the alphabet will be removed from the law until all things are accomplished.</p>

                    <img src="img/beatchapellong.png" class="img-responsive" name="beatchapellong" title="beatchapellong" />
                    <p>Whoever breaks even one of the least of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('commandments')">commandments</a>, and teaches men to break them, will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven:</p>

                    <p>But, whoever teaches the law of God -- and also does it -- will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                    <p>Unless your righteousness is greater than the righteousness of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scribes')">scribes</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a>, you will not even enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                    <p>You have heard it said for ages, You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever says to his brother, 'Heretic' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say 'You fool' shall be in danger of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('hell')">hell</a> fire.</p>

                    <p>If you are offering your <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('sacrifices')">gift</a> at the altar, and while you are there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift at the altar and go find your brother and be reconciled, and then come offer your gift.</p>

                    <p>Agree with your adversary quickly, before he goes to the judge, or your adversary will take you in front of the judge, and the judge will turn you over to an <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('officerspharisees')">officer</a> of the court who will cast you into prison.</p>

                    <p>Truly I tell you this, you will not escape your punishment until you have paid the last cent you owe.</p>

                    <p>You have heard that it has been said, You shall not commit adultery. But I say to you, anyone that even looks at a woman with lust for her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</p>

                    <p>If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better that a part of your body perish than your whole body be cast into hell.</p>

                    <p>If your right hand causes you to do evil, cut it off and throw it away: It is better that you cut off a part of your body and throw it away than your whole body be cast into hell.</p>

                    <p>It is said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement. But I say to you, anyone who divorces his wife, except for fornication, makes her an adulteress: And whoever marries her after she is divorced commits adultery.</p>

                    <img src="img/beatitudes.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="beatitudes" title="beatitudes" style="float:right;padding-left:1%;" />
                    <p>Again, you have heard the old saying:</p>

                    <p>'You shall keep the oaths made to God.'</p>

                    <p>And so you swear oaths in which God is not mentioned, thinking that you can avoid keeping your word. I say to you, do not swear and oath at all; not by heaven, for it is the throne of God; not by earth, for it is the footstool of God; not by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king. Do not swear an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</p>

                    <p>Instead, let your speech be 'yes' and 'no.' Anything more than this is of the evil one.</p>

                    <p>You have heard that it is said, 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist the evil person. Whoever hits you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek to him. And if someone takes you to court to take away your coat, let him have your overcoat also.</p>

                    <p>If someone forces you to go a mile with him, go the second mile on your own.</p>


                    <img src="img/seagalsunrise.png" class="img-responsive" name="seagalsunrise" title="seagalsunrise" />
                    <p>Give to the person who asks you for something. If someone wants to borrow something from you, let him borrow it.</p>

                    <p>You have heard that it is said, 'you shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.' But I say to you who are listening, love your enemies, do good to them who hate you, bless them who curse you, and pray for them who persecute you and misuse you.</p>

                    <p>In this way, you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on both the just and the unjust.</p>

                    <p>So, to the person who hits you on one cheek, offer the other; and to the person who takes away your coat, give him your overcoat also. Give to everyone who asks. Do not try and recover your property from someone who borrows it and does not return it.</p>

                    <p>If you only love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('tax')">tax collectors</a> love their friends, and even the sinners love those that love them. If you only do good to those who do good to you, what reward do you have? Even the sinners do that.</p>

                    <p>If you lend to someone, expecting to receive it back, what reward to you have? Even sinners lend money expecting to get an equal amount or more back.</p>

                    <p>Love your enemies and do them good. Keep in mind that God is kind to the unthankful and the evil.</p>

                    <p>If you give a kind greeting to your friends and relatives only, what is noteworthy about that? Everyone does that.</p>

                    <p>You are to be merciful, even as your Father is merciful. You are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
