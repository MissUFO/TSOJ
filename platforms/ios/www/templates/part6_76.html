                    <h1>Scribes Criticize Jesus</h1>
                    <p>Jesus returned to <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('galilee')">Galilee</a> where he continued his ministry. But he did not return to <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('judea')">Judea</a> because the Jews were determined to kill him.</p>

                    <p>A group of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> came from Jerusalem and joined some <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scribes')">scribes</a>. They began to question Jesus. They had seen some of Jesus' <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">disciples</a> eat their food with unwashed hands. They considered this a defilement and rebellion against the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('traditionelders')">tradition of the elders</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Pharisees and the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scribes')">scribes</a> asked Jesus:</p>

                    <p>Why don't your disciples follow the traditions of the elders?</p>

                    <p>Jesus told them:</p>

                    <img src="img/5_39idumea.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="idumea" title="idumea" />
                    <p>Why do you disobey the commandment of God? Because of your traditions? You hypocrites. The prophet <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('isaiah')">Isaiah</a> was right about you when he said:</p>

                    <p>This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>

                    <p>They worship me in vain, teaching instead the precepts and principles of men.</p>

                    <p>You push away the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('commandments')">commandments of God</a> and hold fast the traditions of men. You would rather obey man than obey God.</p>

                    <p>For God, through <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('lawsofmoses')">Moses</a>, said:</p>

                    <p>Honor your father and your mother,  let anyone who speaks evil of his father or mother be put to death.</p>

                    <p>But you have undone the clear intention of Gods law with your own traditions.</p>

                    <p>You refuse to support your parents in their old age by calling the money that should be used for your parents a special gift to God.</p>

                    <p>That allows you to keep the gift for yourself instead of using it to support your parents.</p>

                    <p>In this way you insult God and create a tradition that undoes God's purpose that you should support your parents in their old age.</p>

                    <p>This is just one example of the ways you subvert the true intentions of God's commands with your own traditions.</p>

                    <p>Jesus called the crowds of people to him.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>It is not what goes into a man's mouth that corrupts or defiles him, it is what comes out of his mouth that corrupts and defiles.</p>

                    <p>Jesus then entered into the home where he was staying. His disciples came to him and said:</p>

                    <p>Did you know that you greatly offended the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> by what you said?</p>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. Leave the Pharisees alone; they are blind guides. The blind guides and the blind who they lead will both fall into a pit.</p>

                    <p>Peter said to Jesus:</p>

                    <p>Tell us the meaning of what you said to the Pharisees.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>You don't understand that it is not the outside things that defile a man but the things that are in his heart.</p>

                    <p>If a man eats meat, it goes into his stomach and through his digestive system and is then flushed out of his system. It does not go through the heart of a man.</p>

                    <p>It is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean, and they are:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evil thoughts</li>

                        <li>Deceit</li>
                        <li>Sensuality and envious eye</li>

                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>All these evil things are produced from inside a man. Eating with unwashed hands does not defile a man.</p>
