        <h1><span>Yeast</span></h1>

        <p>A symbol of sin throughout the Bible.</p>
        <p>In the Passover meal, the bread is unleavened (leaven is another word for yeast; see Exodus 12: 15-20).</p>
        <p>At the last supper with his disciples, Jesus held up a piece of unleavened bread and said, " this is my body which is given for youâ€¦" showing that the bread represented him, and that he was without sin. (Luke 22: 19)</p>
        <p>When Jesus says in Luke 12: 1, "Beware of the leaven (yeast) of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy," he is saying that just like yeast pervades dough and puffs up the whole loaf, sin (in this case hypocrisy) gets in our life, pervades and contaminates us, and causes us to get "puffed up" (prideful and selfish).</p>
        <p>When we are full of ourselves, we don't love God or others, which goes against the greatest commandments that are to love God and love others.</p>
