        <h6>The Italian painter Botticelli followed</h6>
        <h6>traditional Renaissance iconography when</h6>
        <h6>he painted Gabriel adjacent to outdoor space</h6>
        <h6>and the Virgin enclosed by walls.</h6>
        <h1><span>Gabriel</span></h1>

        <p>Gabriel is one of two angels mentioned by name in the Bible. </p>

        <p>Angels are created beings whose purpose is to be messengers of God. He appeared to Mary to tell her that she would become pregnant and give birth to Jesus while she was still a virgin (Luke 1: 26-38). </p>
        
        <p>He appeared to Zacharias about 6 months before that to tell him that his wife would have a son who would be John the Baptist (Luke 1: 11-25). Gabriel was also sent to Daniel (Daniel 8: 16; 9: 21).</p>
