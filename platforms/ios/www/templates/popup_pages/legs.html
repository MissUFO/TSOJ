        <p> Since the cross stood upright, victims were in a position where the only way they could exhale was to push on their feet to try to raise themselves up. Eventually they would suffocate. In order to speed up the process, the soldiers would <strong>break the victim's legs</strong> so they couldn't push themselves up to breathe.</p>
        <p>This was done to the two thieves on either side of Jesus, but when the soldiers came to Jesus, they didn't break his legs because they saw he was already dead.</p>
