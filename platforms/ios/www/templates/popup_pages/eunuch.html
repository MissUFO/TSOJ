        <p>A confidential court official, usually one who was castrated.</p>
        <p>In Matthew 19: 12, Jesus was talking about men who voluntarily abstain from marriage so they can devote their energies to serving God.</p>
        <p>The implication here and in other places in the Bible is that some men are called to this but marriage is also an honorable choice.</p>
