        <h1><span>Levite</span></h1>

        <p>Descendents of Levi who were responsible for maintaining the sanctuary and assisting the priests.</p>

        <p> When the Jews were in the wilderness about 1,400 years before Christ, this meant setting up, dismantling and loading up the pieces of the tabernacle every time they moved. (The tabernacle was a tent sanctuary.)</p>

        <p>When a permanent temple was built the Levites took care of the building and assisted the priests. They were exempt from military service.</p>
