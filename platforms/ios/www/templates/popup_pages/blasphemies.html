        <p>Speaking evil or insults about God or to God.</p>
        <p>The Jewish religious leaders accused Jesus of blasphemy when he claimed he was equal with God. The fact that they accused him of blasphemy shows that they understood clearly that he was a man claiming to be God, not just a nice guy or a good teacher.</p>
        <p> The fact that Jesus, who was obviously fully human, was claiming to be the God who created the universe, was considered by the Jewish religious leaders to be an insult to God.</p>
