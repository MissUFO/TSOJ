        <h1><span>Perfumed Oil</span></h1>

        <p>Throughout the Bible, oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit. Before Christ, God mandated that oil was to be used in ceremonies to anoint or set someone apart for a special job, such as a prophet, priest or king. Anointment symbolized that they would receive special abilities and wisdom from God.</p>
        <p>It was also used in common situations like perfume or personal hygiene. Some perfumed oils were used along with cloths in the embalming process. Jesus' anointment symbolized that he came to the world as prophet, priest and king.</p>
