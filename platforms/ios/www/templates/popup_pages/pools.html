        <p>Bethesda and Siloam were two pools in Jerusalem during the time of Jesus' public ministry.</p>

        <p>It is difficult to know exactly what they were like because the Romans were thorough in destroying Jerusalem about 70 years after Jesus was born.</p>

        <p>They were both fed by streams outside the city. Siloam was the only permanent water source for Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>The water came into the city through Hezekiah's tunnel, which was dug 800 years before Jesus was born.</p>
        <p>The pool of Bethesda was probably more of a bath, which would have been typical in Roman times.</p>
        <p>It had five porches and was located on the east side of Jerusalem near the Fortress of Antonia.</p>
        <p>The Bible records that at this pool, an angel would move the waters at certain times and the first person to enter the water when that happened would be healed of their sickness. Jesus healed a lame man here (John 5: 1-9).</p>
