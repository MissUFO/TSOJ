        <h1><span>Stoning</span></h1>

        <p>The Jewish law prescribed stoning as the punishment for certain offenses. The convicted person would be taken to a place outside of town and people would throw rocks at him until he died.</p>
        
        <p>It is interesting that one of the offenses for which people would be stoned is blasphemy. The Jewish leaders gave their reason for killing Jesus as blasphemy, but since the Romans were in charge, Jesus was crucified instead.</p>
        <p>Later, scholars realized that if Jesus had been stoned, he would not have fulfilled many of the many of the prophecies of how he would die, such as Psalm 22: 13-18.</p>
