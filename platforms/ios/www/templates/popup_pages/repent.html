        <p>To change your mind and purpose.</p>

        <p>Specifically in the Bible it means to turn away from sin and turn to God.</p>

        <p>When we truly repent, we are conscious of our guilt and also of God's mercy. The result of true repentance is a change in behavior.</p>

        <p>It is more than just feeling sorry about our sin or being sorry we got caught.</p>
