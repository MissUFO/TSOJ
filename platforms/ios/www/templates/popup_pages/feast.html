        <p>A yearly Jewish feast to commemorate the 40 years the Jews wandered in the desert after they came out of Egypt. It was also a thanksgiving for the harvest.</p>
        <p>It is also called the "feast of booths" because the Jews stayed in booths (tents) for a few days to remember when they lived in tents for 40 years in the desert.</p>
