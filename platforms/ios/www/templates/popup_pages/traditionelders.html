        <h1><span>Tradition of the Elders</span></h1>

        <p>Oral and written teaching of rabbis (religious teachers) handed down from generation to generation.</p>

        <p>By the time Jesus lived, the Torah had been in existence for about 1,400 years, so there were many additional teachings which had been collected.</p>

        <p>Most of these traditions were attempts to determine how the Law which God had given them should be applied to specific situations.</p>
        <p> Sometimes it was helpful, and sometimes it influenced people to be more concerned about the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law. That's what Jesus was talking about in Matthew 5: 17-48.</p>
