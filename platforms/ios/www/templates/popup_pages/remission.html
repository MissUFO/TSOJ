        <p>If someone else pays off your debt, your creditor is satisfied and you don't owe anymore.</p>
        
        <p>The penalty for our sin is death. We are sinners and our penalty is death, but Jesus paid it for us. He is the only one who could because he is the only man who lived a perfect life.</p>
