        <h6>A typical Passover Sedar</h6>
        <h6> including unleavened bread and bitter herbs</h6>
        <h1><span>Passover</span></h1>

        <p>This is a feast commemorating the deliverance of the Jews from Egypt. The Jews were slaves in Egypt when God sent Moses to tell the Pharaoh to let them go. He refused, so God sent nine plagues to persuade him.</p>

        <p>When Pharaoh still refused, the Lord sent a tenth and final plague. The Lord sent an angel to kill the firstborn of every house, even of the animals.</p>
        
        <p>However, God warned the Jews and told them that if they killed a lamb and put some of the blood on their doorpost, the angel would "pass over" their house and they would be protected. It happened just that way, and Pharaoh finally relented and let the Jews leave Egypt. Jewish people still celebrate Passover each year.</p>
        
        <p>The feast involves eating a lot of different items that have deep significance relating to this event and God's ongoing faithfulness to the Jews. Unleavened bread, bitter herbs, wine, and roasted lamb are just a few.</p>
        <p>This feast took on new significance at the last supper that Christ had with his disciples when he said that he was about to fulfill the symbolism of the Passover celebration by becoming the ultimate "Passover Lamb."</p>
        <p>As we trust our lives to Jesus, he "covers" us from God's wrath by forgiving our sin and bringing us into a new relationship with him.  Our salvation is based on what Christ has done, not how many rules we follow.</p>
