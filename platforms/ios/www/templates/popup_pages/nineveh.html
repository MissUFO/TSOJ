        <h1><span>Nineveh</span></h1>

        <p>The capital city of Assyria when it was a powerful empire about 800 years before Jesus was born.</p>
        <p>God told Jonah to go there and preach to the Ninevites. At first Jonah refused and tried to run away from God, but ended up being thrown in the ocean and swallowed by a big fish.</p>
        <p>Jonah changed his mind, and when the fish spit him up on the shore three days later, he went to Nineveh. Many people in Nineveh listened to his message and followed God. (See the book of Jonah)</p>
