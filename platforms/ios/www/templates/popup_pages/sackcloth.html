        <p>Cloth made of goat or camel hair that was uncomfortable because it caused skin irritation.</p>
        <p>It was worn during times of repentance and mourning and covered the body from neck to ankles as if for burial. It was a sign of deep humility.</p>
        <p>People would often put ashes on their heads as a further sign of humiliation and self abhorrence.</p>
