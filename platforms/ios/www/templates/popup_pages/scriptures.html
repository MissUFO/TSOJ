        <h1><span>Scriptures</span></h1>

        <p>A collection of sacred writings.</p>

        <p>God communicated his message to specific people and they wrote it down (2 Peter 1: 21; 2 Timothy 3: 16).</p>

        <p>When Jesus was living, the Scripture was considered what we call the Old Testament.</p>
        <p>They are also referred to as the "Law and the Prophets." The New Testament was written by the apostles and people close to the apostles within a few years after Jesus died. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are called the Gospels.</p>
        <p>They are accounts of Jesus' life and ministry written from the perspective of each writer.</p>
        <p>The Acts of the Apostles, or Acts for short, is the account of how the good news of Jesus was spread to different parts of the world.</p>
        <p>Revelation is a record of a vision that the apostle John had about some of the churches in his day and about the end of the world when Jesus will return to earth, and create a new heaven and new earth.</p>
        <p>The other books in the New Testament are letters written mostly by apostles to individuals or churches to give them instruction about the meaning of Jesus' life, death and resurrection, how the Holy Spirit works in our lives, and encouragement to act on what we believe.</p>
