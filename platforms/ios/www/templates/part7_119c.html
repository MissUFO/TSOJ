                    <h3>The Wicked Husbandmen</h3>

                    <p>Then Jesus began to speak to the people, if not the rulers, in <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('parable')">parables</a>:</p>

                    <p>Hear another parable:</p>

                    <p>There was a man who was the head of a household who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press and built a tower. He leased it out to a tenant. He left and went into another country where he stayed for a long time.</p>

                    <p>When the season was right, he sent one of his servants to collect the rent.</p>

                    <p>Instead of paying him, the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed.</p>

                    <p>He then sent another servant, who the tenants treated even worse than the first servant.</p>

                    <p>He sent a third servant, who the tenants killed.</p>

                    <img src="img/winemosaic.png" class="img-responsive" name="winemosaic" title="winemosaic" />
                    <p>The man sent more servants, but every servant the man sent was either killed, stoned or beaten by the tenants.</p>

                    <p>Finally the lord of the vineyard sent his son. Surely they will respect the son of the lord of the vineyard.</p>

                    <p>When the tenants saw the son coming they reasoned that if they killed the son they could steal his inheritance and take the vineyard for themselves.</p>

                    <p>So they took the lord's son, threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</p>

                    <p>Jesus asked his listeners:</p>

                    <p>When the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to the tenants?</p>

                    <p>Some of the people answered:</p>

                    <p>He will utterly destroy them and all who serve him and lease the vineyard out to another.</p>

                    <p>Others said:</p>

                    <p>God forbid!</p>

                    <p>Jesus looked at them and said:</p>

                    <img src="img/seasidefloers.png" class="img-responsive" name="seasidefloers" title="seasidefloers" />
                    <p>What is written? Have you never heard the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">Scripture</a>:</p>

                    <p>The stone which the builders rejected was made the head cornerstone. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes.</p>

                    <p>I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation that produces fruit.  Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken in pieces, and anyone the stone falls on will be pulverized into dust.</p>

                    <p>When the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> heard Jesus say this, they tried to arrest him. They understood that he had told the parable as a way of turning the people against them.</p>

                    <p>But the fear of the crowd, who thought Jesus was a prophet, kept the Pharisees from carrying out their plans to arrest Jesus.</p>

                    <p>The religious leaders left Jesus and went away.</p>
