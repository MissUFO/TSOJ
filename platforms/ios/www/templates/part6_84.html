                    <h1>Childlikeness</h1>
                    <p>The disciples began to argue with each other about who was going to be the greatest in the kingdom. Jesus asked them:</p>

                    <p>On the way here, were you talking among yourselves about who would be the greatest?</p>

                    <p>But they kept silent.</p>

                    <p>Jesus sat down and called <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">the 12</a> to come and sit around him. He told them:</p>

                    <p>If a man would be first, he will be last of all and the servant of all.</p>

                    <p>Later on that day, the disciples came to Jesus and asked:</p>

                    <p>Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</p>

                    <p>Jesus called over a small child and set him by his side while he sat in the middle of the disciples. He took the child into his arms and said:</p>


                    <img src="img/judeangrave.png" class="img-responsive" name="judeangrave" title="judeangrave" />
                    <p>Unless you change and become as a little child you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                    <p>Whoever humbles himself as this little child, that person is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                    <p>Jesus continued:</p>

                    <p>Whoever receives a little child in my name, receives me.  Anyone who receives me, does not only receive me but also receives the one who sent me.</p>

                    <p>The one who is the least among you, is the one who is great.</p>

                    <p>John said:</p>

                    <p>Master, we saw someone casting out <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('demon')">demons</a> in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>Don't stop him. No one who is doing mighty works in my name will be quick to speak evil of me. The person who is not against us is for us.</p>

                    <p>Whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to me; truly, he will not lose his reward.</p>

                    <p>Whoever causes one of these little ones that believes in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he was thrown into the sea to sink to the bottom.</p>

                    <p>The wickedness of man makes sin inevitable, but that does not remove the responsibility from the person that causes others to sin.</p>

                    <p>If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and go into <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('hell')">hell</a>.</p>

                    <p>If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life limping on one leg than to have both your feet, and to be cast into hell.</p>

                    <p>If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. Better to enter into life with only sight in one eye than to have two eyes and enter into hell. </p>

                    <p>In <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('hell')">hell</a> the worm never dies, and the fire never goes out.</p>

                    <p>For everyone is salted with salt, but if the salt has lost its saltiness then how will it be seasoned? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another.</p>

                    <p>See that you do not despise these little ones.</p>

                    <p>What do you think? If a man has 100 sheep and one of them goes astray, won't he leave the 99 and go find the missing sheep?</p>

                    <p>When he finds the lost sheep, won't he be happier about finding it than the 99 that had not gone astray? It is the will of your Father in heaven that not one of these little ones should perish.</p>
