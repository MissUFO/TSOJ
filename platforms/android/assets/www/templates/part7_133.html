                    <h1>The Lord's Prayer</h1>

                    <p>These are the words that Jesus spoke as he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said:</p>

                    <p>Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, so that the Son may glorify you. Even as you have given me authority over all people, so that all the ones you have given me, I should give eternal life.</p>

                    <p>And this is <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('eternal')">eternal life</a>, that they should know you, the only true God, and the one you sent.</p>

                    <p>I glorified you on earth, and have accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now Father, glorify me with your own glory which you had before the world existed.</p>

                    <p>I manifested your name to the men you gave me out of this world. They belong to you, and you gave them to me.</p>


                    <img src="img/jeruherodmodel.png" class="img-responsive" name="jeruherodmodel" title="jeruherodmodel" />
                    <p>They have kept your word. Now they know that all things you have given me, are from you. The words that you gave me, I have given to them. And they have received them, and they know that the truth came from you and they believe that you sent me.</p>

                    <p>I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those that you have given me, for they are yours.</p>

                    <p>I am not going to be in the world anymore, but I am coming to be with you.</p>

                    <p>They are in the world.</p>

                    <p>Holy Father, keep them in your name which you gave me, that they may be one, even as we are one.</p>

                    <p>While I was with them I kept them in your name, I guarded them and not one of them has perished, except the son of perishing, in order that the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">scriptures</a> might be fulfilled.</p>

                    <p>But now I am coming to you, and I am speaking these things in the world so that they may have my joy made full in themselves.</p>

                    <p>I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of this world, even as I am not of the world.</p>

                    <p>I do not pray that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.</p>

                    <p>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('sanctified')">Sanctify</a> them with your truth. Your word is truth.</p>

                    <p>Just as you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, so that they will also be sanctified in truth.</p>

                    <p>I not only pray for these, but also I pray for all those who will believe in me through their word: -- that they may all be one, even as you Father are in me, and I am in you. I pray that they may be in us, that the world may believe that you sent me.</p>

                    <p>And the glory which you have given to me, I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one.</p>

                    <p>I in them and you in me, so they may be perfected into one. So that the world will know that you sent me and love them, even as you love me.</p>

                    <p>Father, I desire that the ones you have given to me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which you have given to me. For you loved me before the foundation of the world.</p>

                    <p>Oh righteous Father, the world did not know you, but I know you. And those who you have given me, they know that you sent me. I have made your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love that you love me with may be in them, and I in them.</p>
