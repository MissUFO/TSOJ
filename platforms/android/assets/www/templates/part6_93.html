                    <h1>The Good Shepherd</h1>

                    <p>Jesus continued to teach the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> who were questioning him:</p>

                    <p>The person who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but instead climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.</p>

                    <p>But the one who enters in by the door, he is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>

                    <p>The gatekeeper opens the door to the shepherd from the inside, and when the sheep hear the shepherd's voice as he calls his own sheep by name, they follow.</p>

                    <p>They recognize the shepherd's voice and they follow him. They will not follow a stranger but will flee from him, because they do not recognize his voice.</p>

                    <p>Jesus spoke to them in parables but they did not understand what he was saying. He tried again:</p>

                    <p>I am the door to the sheep. Everyone who came before is a thief or robber, and the sheep did not hear them.</p>

                    <img src="img/bedsheperd.png" class="img-responsive" name="bedsheperd" title="bedsheperd" />
                    <p>I am the door. If anyone enters in through me, he will be saved, and will go in and out, and will find pasture.</p>

                    <p>The thief only comes to steal and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that you might have life, and have it more abundantly.</p>

                    <p>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays his life down for the sheep. The hired hand will not lay his life down for his sheep.</p>

                    <p>If the wolf comes, the hired hand runs away and lets the sheep be scattered and killed. He runs because he does not care about the sheep; he is just a hired hand.</p>

                    <p>I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and they know me. Just like the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>

                    <p>I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must be their shepherd also. They will hear my voice and they will follow me. They will all become one flock with one shepherd.</p>

                    <p>The Father loves me because I lay down my life, so that I can take it up again. No one is going to take it away from me, but will lay it down myself.</p>

                    <p>I have the power to lay it down and I have the power to take it up again. This commandment I received from my Father.</p>

                    <p>These words caused a division among the Jews of Jerusalem. Many said:</p>

                    <p>He has a <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('demon')">demon</a> or he is insane, why are you listening to him.</p>

                    <p>Others said:</p>

                    <p>These are not the words of a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</p>
