        <p><strong>David</strong> was the second king of Israel. He lived about 1,000 years before Christ was born. God promised him that the Messiah would come from his family line.</p>
        
        <p>He was the youngest son of Jesse and their hometown was Bethlehem. While he was a shepherd, he learned to play the harp and use a slingshot. He was told at a young age by Samuel the prophet that he would eventually be king. </p>
        <p>He killed Goliath. He was also a friend of Jonathan, who was the son of King Saul. Saul tried to kill David and failed. After David was king and married to Michal, he got Bathsheba pregnant and then made sure her husband, who was an officer in the army, would get killed in battle. </p>
        
        <h3><img src="img/solomonkingdom.jpg"></h3>
        <p>When God told Nathan the prophet to confront David about it, he repented. Bathsheba's first son died, but her second son, Solomon, later became king. </p>
        <p>David also wrote many of the Psalms as songs of confession and praise to God.  David also wrote many of the prophesies that were fulfilled when Jesus came to earth. </p>
