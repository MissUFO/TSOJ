        <h1><span>Sadducees</span></h1>

        <p>The Sadducees were Jewish religious leaders who were primarily from the upper-class, were much more sympathetic to the Romans and sought to maintain their aristocratic positions in society. They often disagreed with the Pharisees because the Sadducees rejected the oral traditions and much of the doctrine of the Pharisees.</p>

        <p>The Sadducees were opposed to Jesus because there was the supposed threat that Jesus could potentially overthrow the Roman government, thus jeopardizing their positions of prestige. Sadducees lived primarily in Jerusalem and their lives were often focused around the happenings of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>Herod's temple was done on such a grand scale that the main part took 10 years to build and the outer courts weren't completed until 65 years after Jesus' birth. </p>

        <p>The Sanhedrin (the judicial council of the Jewish people) was comprised primarily of Sadducees.</p>
