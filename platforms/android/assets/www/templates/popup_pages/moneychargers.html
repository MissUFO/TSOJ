        <h1><span>Moneychangers</span></h1>

        <p>Moneychangers were Jews who charged other Jews to change their currency into special temple currency. Many Jews traveled long distances to come to the temple in Jerusalem to sacrifice an animal as a symbol of the penalty for the sins they have committed. If it was too far to bring an animal, they had to buy an animal at the temple, but the people who sold the animals would only take temple currency.</p>

        <p>Over the years, the moneychangers began to charge exorbitant fees for the exchange and the animal sellers were overcharging for the animals.</p>

        <p>Many of the moneychangers were getting rich by overcharging poor people who were sincere about worshipping God. Jesus was upset with the moneychangers because they were not only profiting by being unfair to people who had no other options, but they were doing it on the temple property, which was supposed to be a place of worship.</p>
