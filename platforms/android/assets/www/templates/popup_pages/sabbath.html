        <h1><span>Sabbath</span></h1>

        <p>The <strong>Sabbath</strong> is the last day of the week set aside by the Jews as a day of rest and worship. Based on the fact that God rested on the seventh day when he was creating the universe.</p>

        <p>The fourth of the Ten Commandments is to "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any workâ€¦" (Exodus 20: 8-10).</p>
        
        <p>Over the 1,200 years between the time the 10 commandments were given and the time Jesus lived, the Jews had developed elaborate rules and regulations to define "work." For instance on the Sabbath, a scribe was not allowed to carry a pen in his belt. A jew was only allowed to travel 729 paces (about 2,000 cubits, or less than half a mile) without violating the law. They also made rules to get around the rules. For instance if you stashed some food in different places ahead of time to "establish residences," you could go from each of them another 2,000 cubits and still be legal.</p>
        
        <p>The Jews were outraged at Jesus for healing on the Sabbath because he confronted them for making their rules more important than worshipping God. He was also claiming that he was God and the work that he was doing was just as important as what He did when He created the universe.</p>
        <p>The religious leaders understood exactly what he was saying because they accused him of blasphemy and thought that he should receive the penalty of being killed by stoning.</p>
        <p>It is still a commandment to rest every seventh day. Most Christians set aside Sundays because Jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week.</p>
