        <h1><span>Canaanite</span></h1>

        <p>These were descendants of Canaan who was the son of Ham, the son of Noah.</p>

        <p>They settled in the lowlands along the Mediterranean coast near where the present-day nation of Israel is located.</p>

        <p>Tyre and Sidon were two Canaanite cities. They were known for being seafaring traders and merchants. Each village had a different name for its own god, but generally Canaanites worshipped the sun-god who was known as "Baal."</p>

        <p>They were constant enemies of Israel. Simon was referred to as a Canaanite, not because he was from Canaan, but because he belonged to a specific sect of the zealots who were called "Cananaens."</p>
        <p>Zealots were Jews who wanted to overthrow the occupying Roman army by armed revolt.</p>
