        <h1><span>Crucifixion</span></h1>

        <p>Method of execution used often by the Romans to make an example of criminals.</p>
        <p>The victim was usually scourged by whips with pieces of metal or bone on the ends that would bruise then rip the flesh.</p>
        <p>They would then have their wrists and feet nailed to a cross.</p>
        <p>The pectoral muscles become paralyzed and the pressure on thei chest allows breath to come in, but the only way to exhale is to push up on thei feet.</p>
        <p>Soon, the victims become too weak and suffocate, but sometimes it could take many hours.</p>
        <p> When Jesus was crucified, he suffered physically and died to pay the penalty for our sins. He also suffered spiritually by taking the sins of the world on himself and being separated from God for a while. Even though the Jews accused him, and the Romans were in charge of carrying out the crucifixion, he gave up his life willingly.</p>
