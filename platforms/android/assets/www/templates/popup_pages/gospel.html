        <h1><span>Gospel</span></h1>

        <p>Gospel means "good news" or "glad tidings".</p>
        <p>The first four books of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are referred to as the Gospels because they bring men good news that a saviour has come and his name is Jesus.</p>
        <p>The Gospels are four historical accounts of Jesus' life and ministry. They are written from the perspective of each author, so there are some differences, but many of the details are similar.</p>
        <p>They all come to the conclusion that Jesus was both fully God and fully human, that he lived a sinless life, died willingly by being crucified to pay the penalty for our sins, and came back to life.</p>
        <p>Matthew, Mark and Luke are so similar that in some places they are almost word for word. John includes some information that doesn't appear in any of the others.</p>
        <p>Each author was either an apostle or had close contact with an apostle. The small "g" gospel refers to the "good news" that Jesus came as God in the flesh, lived a perfect life, died on the cross for our sins, rose from the dead, and if we put our faith in Him, he forgives our sins and gives us a relationship with God that begins now and lasts forever.</p>
