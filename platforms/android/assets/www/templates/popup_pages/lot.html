        <h1><span>Lot</span></h1>

        <p>Nephew of Abraham. Lot came with Abraham when he came into the region of Canaan, which includes present day Israel.</p>

        <p>When their herds of animals got too big, they had to split up. Abraham gave Lot first choice of where he wanted to live.</p>

        <p>Lot chose the plains where Sodom was located. Before God destroyed Sodom, he sent angels to warn Lot. He and his family escaped, but contrary to what the angels had instructed them, Lot's wife looked back and immediately turned into a pillar of salt. </p>
