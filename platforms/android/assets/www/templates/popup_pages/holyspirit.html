        <h1><span>Holy Spirit/Trinity</span></h1>
        <p><strong>Holy Spirit</strong> – One of the three persons of the trinity along with God the Father and God the Son. (There is one God; God is three persons; Each person is fully God.) </p>
        
        <p>One of the first places we see the Holy Spirit in the Gospels is when John the Baptist baptizes Jesus. </p>
        <p>The spirit comes down on him like a dove, and a voice out of the heavens (God the Father) says "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." (Matthew 3: 13-17) </p>
        
        <p>Before Jesus lived on earth, the Holy Spirit would empower people from time to time to do a specific task or give a certain message.</p>
        
        <p>Jesus told the apostles that he would be leaving the earth and that the Holy Spirit would come. </p>
        <p>A few weeks after Jesus ascended into heaven, the Holy Spirit came to earth and lives in the lives of each person who puts their trust in Jesus. (See John 16: 7-11 and Acts 1: 4-8 and 2; 1-4). </p>
        <p>He is mentioned specifically as having an active role in drawing people to Jesus, and in giving wisdom and empowering people who trust in Jesus to follow Him in the way they live their lives. </p>
        <p>Trinity – The Bible teaches that there is one God, and at the same time, three distinct persons. </p>
        <p>The word "Trinity" never appears in the Bible, but it is used to represent what the Bible teaches.</p>
        <p>There is one God; God is three persons; Each person is fully God. The three distinct persons are the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>There is not an example that illustrates this idea exactly. Since we are human, we will never understand this idea completely, but it is clearly affirmed in all parts of the Bible. It is part of the mystery of God. </p>
