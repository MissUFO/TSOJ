        <h1><span>Jordan River</span></h1>

        <p>The main river in Palestine.</p>

        <p>It is in a deep valley and flows north to south, from north of the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. In the course of about 100 miles, the riverbed drops more than 2,300 feet.</p>

        <p>God miraculously held back the Jordan River so the Israelites could walk across as if they were â€œon dry ground (Joshua 3: 17). John the Baptist baptized people in the Jordan River, including Jesus, when Jesus began his public ministry (Mark 1: 9).</p>
