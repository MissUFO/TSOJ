        <p>Located at the northern end of modern day Jordan and just south of the Golan Heights, Gadara was in the time of Jesus a town in the region of The Gadarenes in Decapolis. The Gadarenes, on the southeast end of the Sea of Galilee, was the scene of one of Jesus' miracles. It was there that Jesus cast out the demons from a group of men who lived in caves.</p>
