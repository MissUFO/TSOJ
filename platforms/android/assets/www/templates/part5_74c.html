                    <h3>Jesus Walks on Water</h3>
                    <p>Jesus knew that these crowds of people wanted to take him by force to make him King.</p>

                    <p>He told his <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">12 disciples</a> to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the shore on the other side of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('bethsaida')">Bethsaida</a>, the town next to <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('capernaum')">Capernaum</a>. He then sent the multitude away.</p>

                    <p>Jesus then went up into the mountain to pray. The evening came, and Jesus was alone.</p>

                    <p>As the disciples rowed to Capernaum, a great wind blew up. They were about three and a half miles across the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('seaofgalilee')">lake</a>, about half way to where Jesus had told them to go.</p>

                    <p>Jesus looked across the lake and saw that his disciples were in trouble, trying to row the boat against the wind.</p>

                    <p>Jesus walked on the water toward the disciples.</p>

                    <p>When the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water in their direction, they were afraid. They thought it was a ghost, and they cried out with fear.</p>

                    <img src="img/3_20capernaum.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="capernaum" title="capernaum" />
                    <p>But Jesus spoke to them and said:</p>

                    <p>Take heart, it is I, do not be afraid.</p>

                    <p>They started preparing for Jesus to enter the boat. But Simon Peter said to Jesus:</p>

                    <p>If it is you, then ask me to come meet you on the water.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>Come.</p>

                    <p>Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. But when he saw the force of the wind, he was afraid and began to sink.</p>

                    <p>He cried out:</p>

                    <p>Lord save me.</p>

                    <img src="img/seagalsunrise.png" class="img-responsive" name="seagalsunrise" title="seagalsunrise" />
                    <p>Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and took hold of Peter. He said to Peter:</p>

                    <p>Oh you of little faith, why did you doubt?</p>

                    <p>As soon as Jesus and Peter went into the boat,  the wind stopped blowing. The disciples were amazed and began worshipping him, saying:</p>

                    <p>It is the truth, you are the Son of God.</p>

                    <p>When they had crossed  the lake, they came to the land of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('gennesaret')">Gennesaret</a>, where they moored their boat.</p>

                    <p>As soon as Jesus and his disciples left the boat, the people recognized who he was and began sending word around the  region that Jesus was there.</p>

                    <p>Jesus went about healing the sick, and many asked Jesus if they could touch the border of his garment. All who did were made whole. </p>
