                    <h1>Pilate Sentences Jesus</h1>

                    <p>Now it was the custom at the feast of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('passover')">Passover</a> that the authorities would release a prisoner. And there was one notable prisoner, a murderer and a rebel against <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('rome')">Rome</a> named Barabbas.</p>

                    <p>And the multitude went up to <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pilate')">Pilate</a> and began demanding their annual gift of a released prisoner. Pilate saw this as an opportunity to escape his difficulties over Jesus.</p>

                    <p>When they had gathered together, Pilate asked them:</p>

                    <p>Would you like me to release Jesus, the King of the Jews? I have examined him and I can find no fault in him.</p>

                    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('herod')">Herod</a> cannot find anything wrong with him either. According to your custom, I will chastise Jesus and then release him.</p>

                    <p>Or I can release Barabbas. Which would you like me to release to you, Barabbas, a murderer and a rebel or Jesus?</p>

                    <img src="img/jerualllight.png" class="img-responsive" name="jerualllight" title="jerualllight" />
                    <p>But they cried out all together, saying:</p>

                    <p>Away with this man, release Barabbas.</p>

                    <p>While Pilate was sitting in the judgment seat, a message came from his wife. The message said:</p>

                    <p>I have had terrible dreams regarding this man Jesus, you must release him and have nothing further to do with him.</p>

                    <p>The chief <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('priest')">priests</a> and the elders stirred up the multitude so that they should demand the release of Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</p>

                    <p>They cried out again saying:</p>

                    <p>Not his man, but Barabbas.</p>

                    <p>Pilate spoke to them again trying to persuade them that he should release Jesus.</p>

                    <p>The crowds would hear none of it and began shouting:</p>

                    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('crucified')">Crucify</a>, crucify him.</p>

                    <p>They all said:</p>

                    <p>Let him be crucified.</p>

                    <p>Pilate tried the third time, asking them:</p>

                    <p>What evil has this man done? I can find nothing in him that deserves death: I will chastise him and release him.</p>

                    <img src="img/romesidenav.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="romesidenav" title="romesidenav" />
                    <p>But the crowds just became more agitated, saying:</p>

                    <p>Crucify him. Let him be crucified.</p>

                    <p>Then Pilate took Jesus and <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scourged')">scourged</a> him.</p>

                    <p>And the soldiers forced a crown of thorns on his head and put a purple robe around his neck. They came to him and said:</p>

                    <p>Hail, King of the Jews!</p>

                    <p>And they struck him with their hands.</p>

                    <p>Pilate hoped that the crowd would be satisfied with the humiliation and punishment of Jesus. He had Jesus brought out in front of the people wearing a crown of thorns and a purple robe. Pilate said to them:</p>

                    <p>Behold, the man!</p>

                    <p>When the chief priests and the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('officerspharisees')">officers</a> saw him they cried out:</p>

                    <p>Crucify him, crucify him.</p>

                    <p>Pilate said:</p>

                    <p>Take him and crucify him yourselves, for I can find no crime in him.</p>

                    <p>The Jews answered him:</p>

                    <p>We have a law that he should die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God.</p>

                    <p>When Pilate heard this he was even more afraid and went into the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('praetorium')">Praetorium</a> again, taking Jesus with him.</p>

                    <p>He questioned Jesus:</p>

                    <p>Where did you come from?</p>

                    <p>But Jesus did not give him and answer. Pilate said to him:</p>

                    <p>Don't you know that I have the power to release you or to crucify you?</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>You would have no power against me, except it was given to you from above. Therefore, he who delivered me up to you has the greater sin.</p>

                    <p>Hearing this Pilate sought even more to release Jesus.</p>

                    <p>But the Jews cried out saying:</p>

                    <p>If you release him then you are no friend of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('tiberius')">Caesar's</a>. Everyone who makes himself a king is in opposition to Caesar.</p>

                    <p>When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and sat him down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, (in Hebrew it was called, Gabbatha.)</p>

                    <p>It was the Preparation of the Passover, about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews:</p>

                    <p>Behold your King.</p>

                    <p>They cried:</p>

                    <p>Away with him, away with him. Crucify him!</p>

                    <p>Pilate asked:</p>

                    <p>Shall I crucify your King?</p>	

                    <p>The chief priests cried out:</p>

                    <p>We have no king but <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('tiberius')">Caesar</a>.</p>

                    <p>Finally, Pilate gave up. The harder he tried to release Jesus the more agitated the crowd became in their determination to have Christ crucified.</p>

                    <p>Pilate took water and washed his hands before the people. He said:</p>

                    <p>I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. And the people answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</p>

                    <p>Pilate then released Barabbas and turned Jesus over to them, to be crucified.</p>

                    <p>The soldiers of Pilate led Jesus away to the Praetorim court where they gathered other soldiers.</p>

                    <p>And when they had gathered a band of soldiers together, they stripped Jesus and clothed him again in purple robes, and again they placed the crown of thorns on his head and began mocking him.</p>

                    <p>They kneeled down to him and saluted him, saying:</p>

                    <p>Hail, King of the Jews!</p>

                    <p>And they spat on him and struck his head with a stick, and bowed their knees as if they were worshipping him. </p>
