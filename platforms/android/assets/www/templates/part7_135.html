                    <h1>Jesus Betrayed, Arrested, and Forsaken</h1>

                    <p>Now Judas, who betrayed Jesus, knew the place where Jesus and his <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">disciples</a> met. Judas and a band of soldiers and <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('officerspharisees')">officers</a> from the chief <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('priest')">priests</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pharisees')">Pharisees</a> came with lanterns, torches and weapons.</p>

                    <p>Jesus knew all the things that were going to happen to him.</p>

                    <p>He went up to Judas and his band of soldiers and said to them:</p>

                    <p>Who are you looking for?</p>

                    <p>They answered him:</p>

                    <p>Jesus of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('nazareth')">Nazareth</a>.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>I am he.</p>

                    <img src="img/romesidenav.jpg" class="img-responsive" name="romesidenav" title="romesidenav" />
                    <p>When Jesus spoke Judas and the band of soldiers fell backwards on to the ground.</p>

                    <p>Again Jesus asked:</p>

                    <p>Who do you seek?</p>

                    <p>They answered:</p>

                    <p>Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

                    <p>When Jesus spoke, they again fell backwards on to the ground.</p>

                    <p>Again he asked them:</p>

                    <p>Who are you looking for?</p>

                    <p>And again they said:</p>

                    <p>Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>I told you that I am he, if it is me you are looking  then let my disciples go on their way.</p>

                    <img src="img/jeruprophettomb.png" class="img-responsive" name="jeruprophettomb" title="jeruprophettomb" />
                    <p>This was so that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke:</p>

                    <p>Of those you have given me, I have not lost one.</p>

                    <p>Now the one who betrayed Jesus had given them a token saying:</p>

                    <p>Whoever I kiss, that is Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to Judas:</p>

                    <p>Are you going to betray the Son of man with a kiss?</p>

                    <p>Judas came to Jesus and kissed him.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to him:</p>

                    <p>Friend, do what you have come for.</p>

                    <p>Then they came and took hold of Jesus, and arrested him. And while they were surrounding Jesus, one of Jesus' disciples said:</p>

                    <p>Lord shall we strike them with a sword?</p>

                    <p>Simon took the sword that he had and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>

                    <p>But Jesus answered and said to them:</p>

                    <p>Do not interfere with those arresting me.</p>

                    <img src="img/jerucolumn.png" class="img-responsive" name="jerucolumn" title="jerucolumn" />
                    <p>Then Jesus touched the servant's ear and it was healed. The servant's name was Malchus.</p>

                    <p>Then Jesus said to Peter:</p>

                    <p>Put your sword in its sheath. Those who take the sword will perish by the sword. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?</p>

                    <p>Don't you realize that I could even now ask the Father and he would send twelve legions of <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('angel')">angels</a>? But then how would the scriptures be fulfilled. This is how it must be.</p>

                    <p>As Jesus was taken to the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('temple')">temple</a>, the multitudes and the chief priests and the captains of the temple all came against Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>Are you coming against me like you would a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? When I sat daily with you in the temple teaching, you didn't stretch out your hands against me or arrest me.</p>

                    <p>But this is your hour, and the hour for the power of darkness.</p>

                    <p>This is all happened so that the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">scriptures</a> and the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('prophesied')">prophets</a> would be fulfilled.</p>

                    <p>Then all the disciples left Jesus and fled. One of the friends of Jesus and the disciples, thought to be Mark, followed Jesus with just a linen cloth covering him, and they took hold of him, but he fled naked leaving them holding the linen cloth.</p>
