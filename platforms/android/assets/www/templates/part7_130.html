                    <h1>Judas' Betrayal Foretold</h1>

                    <p>After Jesus said this as he was eating, he became troubled in his spirit and testified:</p>

                    <p>Truly, truly, I tell you that one of you will betray me, someone who is eating with me right now.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">disciples</a> looked at one another, upset and wondering who he was talking about.</p>

                    <p>They became very agitated and sorrowful. Each one asked the Lord:</p>

                    <p>Is it me?</p>

                    <p>And he answered and said to them:</p>

                    <p>It is one of the twelve, He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same is the one who will betray me.</p>

                    <p>I am going to do what the Father has sent me to do, as it is written in <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">scripture</a>, but woe to the man who betrays the Son of man.</p>

                    <p>It would be better if he had not been born.</p>

                    <img src="img/breakbread.png" class="img-responsive" name="breakbread" title="breakbread" />
                    <p>One of the disciples, the one who Jesus loved very much, was reclining on Jesus' bosom. Peter beckoned to him, and told him to ask the Lord who it was that was going to betray him.</p>

                    <p>And the disciple leaned back and asked the Lord:</p>

                    <p>Who is it?</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered:</p>

                    <p>It is the one I will give this bread to when I have dipped it. So Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas Iscariot.</p>

                    <p>Judas answered the Lord and said:</p>

                    <p>It is I, <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('teacher')">Teacher</a>?</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to him:</p>

                    <p>It is as you say.</p>

                    <p>And Satan immediately entered into Judas.</p>

                    <p>And Jesus said to Judas:</p>

                    <p>Go quickly and do what you are going to do.</p>

                    <p>Nobody knew what Jesus meant when he told Judas this. They supposed that Judas, who was in charge of the purse, was being sent on a mission to buy something needed for the rest of the feast.</p>

                    <p>Judas went out into the night.</p>


                    <img src="img/winepitcher.png" class="img-responsive" name="winepitcher" title="winepitcher" />
                    <p>After Judas was gone, Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.</p>

                    <p>Little children, I am only going to be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, but as I said to the Jews, you will not find me or be able to go where I am going.</p>

                    <p>I give you a new commandment -- that you love one another just as I have loved you, so love each other. This is the way that men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.</p>

                    <p>Then Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>This night all will be offended in me, just as it is written, I will smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered abroad.</p>

                    <p>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('galilee')">Galilee</a>.</p>

                    <p>Simon Peter, said to him:</p>

                    <p>Lord, wherever you go I will follow you. I will lay down my life for you.</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered Peter:</p>

                    <p>Will you lay down your life for me? Simon, Simon, behold Satan has asked for you that he might sift you like wheat.</p>

                    <p>But I have prayed for you that your faith does not fail. Here is what I want you to do. Once you have <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('repent')">repented</a>, establish your brothers.</p>

                    <p>Peter protested:</p>

                    <p>Lord I am ready to go to prison for you. I am willing to die for you. If all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to Peter:</p>

                    <p>The truth you need to understand is that before the rooster crows tomorrow morning you will have denied me three times.</p>

                    <p>Peter became agitated and vehemently said that even if he would die, he would not deny him. The other disciples joined in and said the same thing.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>When I sent you out without purse and without wallet or shoes, did you lack anything?</p>

                    <p>They answered:</p>

                    <p>Nothing.</p>

                    <p>And he said to them:</p>

                    <p>But now, he who has money, let him take it and sell it and buy a sword. For I say to you, that what is written will be fulfilled in me:</p>

                    <p>And he was counted with the transgressors. For these things written about me are being fulfilled.</p>

                    <p>And they said:</p>

                    <p>Lord, we have two swords, it that enough?</p>
