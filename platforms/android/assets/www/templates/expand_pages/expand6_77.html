        <h3>77. WITHDRAWAL FROM HEROD'S TERRITORY.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 15: 21;  MARK 7: 24.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> And from thence  Jesus 
            arose, and went  outaway  and withdrew into the parts {borders} of Tyre and Sidon. [<span class="comm">The journey here is 
                indicated in marked terms because it differs from any previously recorded, for 
                it was the first time that Jesus ever entered a foreign or heathen country. 
                Some commentators contend from the use of the word "borders" by 
                Mark that Jesus did not cross over the boundary, but the point is not well 
                taken, for <span class="style7">Mark 7: 31</span> shows that the 
                journey led through Sidon. For the location of Tyre and Sidon, see page 286. 
                Jesus withdrew to escape the opposition of his enemies and the mistaken 
                movements of his friends. As he was not on a missionary tour, it was perfectly 
                proper for him to enter heathen territory.</span>]
