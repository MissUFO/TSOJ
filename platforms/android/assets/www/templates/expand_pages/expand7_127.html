        <h3>127. JUDAS BARGAINS FOR JESUS' DEATH.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">MOUNT OF OLIVES, BETHANY, AND JERUSALEM. TUESDAY AFTER SUNSET,
                WHICH JEWS REGARDED AS THE BEGINNING OF WEDNESDAY.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 26: 1-5, 14-16;  MARK 14: 1, 2, 10, 11;  LUKE 22: 1-6.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5"></span> 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which 
            is called the Passover. {<span class="style7"> 1</span> Now after two 
            days was the feast of the 
            passover and the unleavened bread:} </p> 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> 
            And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his 
            disciples, </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and 
            the Son of man is delvered up to be crucified. (<span class="comm">We may regard Jesus as 
                having entered the temple Tuesday morning, and as having taught there until the 
                evening. He then retired 
                to the slopes of Olivet and delivered the discourse which occupies Sections 124-126, The discourse finished, it is likely that he 
                arose about or a little after sunset (<span class="comm">which the Jews reckoned as Wednesday</span>) and 
                proceeded on his way to Bethany, where he remained until late Thursday 
                afternoon. On his way to Bethany he spoke the words of this section. The two 
                days mentioned are Wednesday and Thursday. The passover was eaten Thursday 
                night after sunset, which the Jews reckoned as Friday. For a full discussion of 
                the time when the Passover was eaten, see Andrews' "Life of 
                Christ," pp. 423-460.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> Then were gathered together the chief 
            priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who 
            was called Caiaphas; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> and they took counsel together 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And 

            sought  
            how  that they might take Jesus by subtlety, 
            and  how they might put him to death; {kill him.} (<span class="comm">This council may have begun on the evening of 
                Tuesday and continued until the beginning of Wednesday, Jewish time. It seems 
                to have been a formal rather than an informal conference. The court where they 
                met was the open space enclosed by the palace of the high priest. Caiaphas had 
                been appointed high priest in a.d. 26 by the Procurator Valerius Gratus and was deposed a.d. 38. Ishmael, Eleazar, and Simon 
                held the office between the deposition of Annas and the appointment of Caiaphas 
                (<span class="comm">Josephus Antiquities 18: 2. 2</span>). See also p. 64.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> But {<span class="style7">2</span> 
            for} they said, Not during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult
            arise among {of} people.
            for they feared the people. (<span class="comm">They knew that there were 
                many at the feast from Galilee, and other sections of the country where Jesus 
                ministered; and, judging by the demonstration made at the triumphal entry, they 
                felt that there were plenty to take arms in Jesus' behalf. The sense of their 
                council, therefore, seemed to be that if Jesus could be taken by 
                subtlety--i. e., arrested privately--he might be taken during 
                the feast. But if he had to be arrested publicly, then it was better to 
                postpone his apprehension until after the feast. The treachery of Judas caused 
                them to adopt the former course. At this place Matthew and Mark insert the 
                account of the supper given to Jesus in the house of Simon the leper. They do 
                this because the treacherous determination of Judas was formed at it and dates 
                from it. The rebuke of the Lord then administered, or the desire to reimburse 
                himself for the price of the ointment, which Mary expended, and which he felt 
                that he ought to have had, or some other reasons, evidently induced him at that 
                time to decide upon our Lord's betrayal. Since then he had been seeking 
                opportunity to betray the Master.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And Satan entered into Judas who was 
            called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. {
            he that was one of the twelve,} (<span class="comm">See pp. 226, 391, 392.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot,
            went away unto the chief priests, that 

            he might deliver him unto them.  and 
            communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto 
            them.  </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> and said, What are ye willing 
            to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? (<span class="comm">It is probable that the 
                proposal to sell his Master was made by Judas to individual members of the 
                Sanhedrin, and that this proposal was one of the moving causes leading to the 
                assembling of the council. The language implies that Judas appeared before the 
                council and bargained openly with it.</span>)   </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And 
            they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised  and 
            covenanted to give him money.  And they weighed unto 
            him thirty pieces of silver. (<span class="comm">There had been coined shekels since the time 
                of Simeon, or 143 b.c., before 
                that the money was weighed. It is likely that the term "weighed" 
                survived the practice and became a synonym or equivalent for 
                "paid." The amount paid him was about fifteen dollars of our money. 
                It was indeed a low price for so base a deed, but from the language used it may 
                be fairly implied that it was but the earnest money of a larger sum. But Judas 
                evidently hardened himself, and shut out all thought as to anything save the 
                actual labor involved. Viewed thus, his task was neither difficult nor 
                dangerous.</span>) </p>  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And he consented, 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver 
            him  how he might conveniently deliver him unto them.   in the 
            absence of the multitude. (<span class="comm">He soon found his opportunity. He bargained on 
                Tuesday night and fulfilled his contract on Thursday night. Or, as the Jews 
                reckoned time, he agreed in the beginning of Wednesday and fulfilled his 
                covenant on the beginning of Friday.</span>)</p>
