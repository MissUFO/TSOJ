        <h3>23. NICODEMUS VISITS JESUS BY NIGHT.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM, APRIL 9, A.D. 27.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 3:1-21.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named 
            Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. (<span class="comm">Nicodemus is mentioned only by John. His 
                character is marked by a prudence amounting almost to timidity. At <span class="style7">John 7: 50-52</SPAN> he defends Jesus, but 
                without committing himself as in any way interested in him: at <span class="style7">John 19: 38, 39 </span>he brought spices for the body 
                of Jesus, but only after Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a had secured the body. 
                Nicodemus was a ruler, or a member of the Sanhedrin</span>): 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> the same came 
            unto him by night (<span class="comm">Thus avoiding the hostility of his colleagues, and also 
                obtaining a more personal and uninterrupted interview with Jesus. That his 
                coming by night revealed his character is shown by the fact that John repeats 
                the expression when describing him at <span class="style7">John 19: 39</span>. But, in justice, it should be said that Nicodemus was the only 
                one of his order who came at all during our Lord's life</span>), and said to 
            him, Rabbi, we [<span class="comm">Nicodemus uses the plural, to avoid committing himself too 
                much. Nicodemus would assert nothing but that which was commonly admitted by 
                many. We learn from <span class="style7">John 12: 42, 43</SPAN> 
                that late in the ministry of Christ, when hostility towards him was most 
                bitter, many of the rulers still believed in him. No doubt, then, when 
                Nicodemus said "we" he used the word advisedly and conscientiously</span>] 
            know that thou art a teacher come from God (<span class="comm">The rulers knew that Jesus 
                was not the product of any of the rabbinical schools, and his miracles marked 
                him as a prophet and distinguished him from all who were guided merely by 
                reason, no matter how learned</span>); for no one can do these signs that 
            thou doest (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 2: 25</SPAN></span>), 
            except God be with him. (<span class="comm">These words show the effect of Christ's miracles. 
                Miracles arrest attention and challenge investigation, 

                and prove that he who works them is from God--<span class="style7">Acts 10: 
                    38</SPAN>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> Jesus answered (<span class="comm">Not the words, but the thoughts of 
                Nicodemus. The answers of Jesus often look rather to the thoughts of the 
                questioner than to the form of the question. Nicodemus came seeking to know 
                something about the kingdom of God, and Jesus opened at once upon the subject</span>) 
            and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, 
            he cannot see the kingdom of God. (<span class="comm">The word translated "anew" 
                may also mean "from above," and some commentators seek to so 
                translate it here, but it is rightly translated "anew," for 
                Nicodemus understood it to mean a second birth. As to the import of the 
                passage, Luther's words are pertinent: "My doctrine is not of doing, and 
                of leaving undone, but of being and becoming; so that it is not a new work to 
                be done, but the being new created--not the living otherwise, but the 
                being new-born." To "see" the kingdom means to possess or 
                enjoy it--<span class="style7">Psalm 16: 10; 90: 15; John 8: 51; 
                    Luke 2: 26</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born 
            when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be 
            born? (<span class="comm">Knowing that a man can not be literally born a second time, 
                Nicodemus states to Jesus the literal import of his words, hoping thereby to 
                draw from him an explanation of this new, strange metaphor which he was using. 
                So far as he did grasp the meaning of Jesus, Nicodemus saw himself barred 
                forever from the kingdom by an impossible requirement. Many, like him, need to 
                learn that God asks of us nothing that is impossible; that, on the contrary, 
                the yoke is easy and the burden is light.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, 
            I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter 
            into the kingdom of God. (<span class="comm">By far the vast majority of scholars consider the 
                word "water" in this verse as a reference to Christian baptism. The 
                Cambridge Bible says "the outward sign and inward grace of Christian 
                baptism are here clearly given, and an unbiased mind can scarcely avoid seeing 
                this plain fact. This becomes still clearer when we compare 

                <span class="style7">John 1: 26, 33</span>, where the Baptist 
                declares, 'I baptize in water', the Messiah 'baptizeth in the Holy Spirit'. The 
                fathers, both Greek and Latin, thus interpret the passage with singular 
                unanimity." Men would have no difficulty in understanding this passage 
                were it not that its terms apparently exclude "the pious 
                unimmersed" from Christ's kingdom. But difficulties, however distressing, 
                will justify no man in wrestling the Scriptures of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Peter 3: 16; Romans 3: 4</span></span>). Water and Spirit are joined at 
                <span class="style7">Matthew 28: 19; Acts 2: 38; 19: 1Ã¢ 7; 
                    Titus 3: 5</span>.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and 
            that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. (<span class="comm">Jesus here draws the 
                distinction between fleshly birth and spiritual birth. He did this to prepare 
                Nicodemus to understand that it is the spirit and not the flesh which 
                undergoes the change called the new birth. Regeneration is no slight, 
                superficial change, but a radical one, and one which we can not work for 
                ourselves.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew. 
            (<span class="comm">Jesus here plainly declares that none are exempt from this gospel requirement. 
                Man must obtain more than his fleshly nature if he would inherit eternal life.</span>)
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but 
            knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is 
            born of the Spirit. (<span class="comm">In this sentence we have the word pneuma 
                translated by the two words "wind" and "spirit." 
                There can be no justification in rendering pneuma "wind," 
                when in the last clause of the same sentence, and three times in the immediate 
                context, it is rendered "spirit." There can be no doubt that it 
                means the same in both clauses of this verse, and if we render it wind in the 
                first clause, we must say "born of the wind" in the last clause. 
                Whatever is the meaning of this verse, it must be extracted from the rendering 
                which the Revisers have strangely placed in the margin, viz.: "The Spirit 
                breathes where it will, and thou hearest," etc. It teaches that a man is 
                born of the Spirit, breathing as he wills through inspired men. It is 
                equivalent to Paul's maxim that faith comes by hearing the 

                word of God. 

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> Nicodemus 
                    answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> Jesus 
                    answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest 
                    not these things? The Jewish teachers or doctors (<span class="comm">of the law made very 
                        arrogant claims to knowledge, but it often happens that the professedly learned 
                        are remarkably unacquainted with the first principles of their religion. It was 
                        so with the Jewish teachers (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 15: 
                                14</span></span>). Nicodemus should have understood that such a change as Jesus 
                        was speaking of would be necessary, for, 1. It was foreshadowed in the Old 
                        Testament (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 10: 16; 1 Samual 10: 9; 16: 13; Psalm 
                                52: 10; Ezekiel 18: 31; Jeremiah 4: 4</span></span>). 2. John the Baptist suggested 
                        the need of some such change when he attacked the Jewish trust in their descent 
                        from Abraham.</span>) 

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We (<span class="comm">a rhetorical 
                        plural--<span class="style7">Mark 4: 30</span></span>) speak that 
                    which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen. (<span class="comm">his words were 
                        not founded upon reasonings, speculations, and guesses, but were the plain 
                        testimony of an eye-witness, who was able to see and had seen things which to 
                        us are invisible</span>); and ye receive not our witness. (<span class="comm">Ye teachers 
                        of Israel, who, above all men, should receive our guidance, are the very last 
                        to follow us. As the Jewish rulers would not receive Christ's testimony, let us 
                        not be surprised if many of our day refuse to listen to the gospel which we 
                        preach.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall 
                    ye believe if I tell you heavenly things? (<span class="comm">Jesus here divides religious 
                        phenomena into two divisions--earthly and heavenly. The earthly phenomena 
                        are those which have their sphere in this world. In this sense 

                        regeneration is an earthly thing; for though it has a heavenly origin, its 
                        manifestations are among the daily sights and experiences of our earthly life. 
                        Religion has also its heavenly phenomena, such as the ordering of God's 
                        celestial household; the experiences of those who pass into the divine 
                        presence; the propitiation, or the changes wrought in the attitude of God 
                        toward man by the sacrifice of Christ; the powers and limitations of Christ's 
                        priestly intercession, etc. These things have their sphere far removed from 
                        earth, and transcended the comprehension of Nicodemus. Now, if Nicodemus would 
                        not believe Jesus when he told him of things which he himself partially knew, 
                        how would he believe when Jesus spoke of that which was utterly unknown to 
                        him?</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of 
                    heaven, even the Son of man, who 
                    is in heaven. (<span class="comm">Nicodemus is here informed that Christ alone can teach 
                        concerning heavenly things. Jesus can so teach, for he did not begin on earth 
                        and ascend to heaven, but he came from heaven to earth, and returned thence 
                        (<span class="comm">afterwards</span>) to heaven. Jesus speaks of himself as being present in heaven, 
                        because his divine nature was in constant communication with the powers of 
                        heaven. If we conceive of heaven as a locality (<span class="comm">a proper conception</span>), Jesus was 
                        upon the earth; but if we conceive of it as a present communion with the 
                        presence of God (<span class="comm">also a proper conception</span>), then Christ was in heaven as he 
                        talked with Nicodemus--<span class="style7">John 8: 
                            29</span>.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, 
                    even so must the Son of man be lifted up; 

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> that whosoever 
                    believeth may in him have eternal life. (<span class="comm">Jesus here indicates the 
                        prophetical character of the Old Testament. The extent of Christ's indorsement 
                        of the Old Testament becomes apparent when we consider on how many occasions he 
                        revealed himself under the same symbolism which the Old Testament used to 
                        reveal him. At <span class="style7">John 2: 19</span> he revealed 
                        his resurrection under the symbolism of the destroyed and restored temple. At 
                        <span class="style7">Matthew 12: 40</span> the same event is 
                        revealed under the symbolism of Jonah and the whale. And 

                        here his crucifixion is likewise partially veiled and partially disclosed under a 
                        symbolic reference to the brazen serpent. The account of the brazen serpent 
                        will be found at <span class="style7">Numbers 21: 4-9</span>. 
                        The lesson of the brazen serpent will be found in its main points of 
                        resemblance to the crucifixion of Christ. When the people were bitten by fiery 
                        serpents, something made to resemble a serpent was hung upon a pole, and the 
                        people who looked to it in faith through it healing and life. Such is the 
                        epitome of Christ's gospel. When the world was perishing because of sin, Jesus, 
                        made to resemble sin (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 8: 3; 2 Corinthians 5: 
                                21</span></span>) was hung upon the cross, that those who look unto him in faith 
                        (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 45: 22</span></span>) may find life through 
                        him--<span class="style7">1 John 5: 11-13</span>.</span>)


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that 
                    whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life. 
                    (<span class="comm">Luther calls this verse "the Bible in miniature." It is a lesson 
                        as to God's love: 1. Its magnitude--he gave his only begotten Son. 2. Its 
                        reach--he gave it to a sinful world (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 5: 
                                8</span></span>). 3. Its impartiality--he gives it to whomsoever; that is, to 
                        all alike (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 5: 45; Revelation 22: 17</span></span>). 
                        4. Its beneficial richness--it blesses with life eternal. 5. Its 
                        limitations--it is nowhere said that God so loves that he will save 
                        unbelievers. Love is the mutual and binding grace between God and man; it may 
                        almost be said that in Christ it made God human and man divine. John uses the 
                        word "eternal" seventeen times in his Gospel and six times in his 
                        first Epistle. He always applies it to life. The synoptists use it eight times, 
                        applying it to life, and also to fire, punishment, damnation, and habitation.</span>) 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the 
                    world should be saved through him. (<span class="comm">Christ's first mission to the world was 
                        for salvation rather than for judgment. His second mission will be for 
                        judgment, but a judgment-hour wherein he will be able to save those who have 
                        accepted the means of grace which he established by his first coming. But the 
                        first coming of Christ incidentally involved judgment (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 9: 39</span></span>), and John the Baptist emphasized the judgment of 
                        Christ. 

                        This judgment, however, was not the principal object of 
                        Christ's coming, but was an inevitable result of it. Jesus here speaks of it as 
                        a self-executed judgment. It was a necessary result of the revealed presence of 
                        Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 2: 35</span></span>). That Christ is at 
                        present a Saviour, and not a judge, is a truth which needs to be emphasized. 
                        Catholics are taught to fear Christ and flee to the Virgin; and many ignorant 
                        Protestants are disposed to look upon him as a prosecutor rather than as an 
                        advocate.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> He that believeth on him is not judged; he that believeth not 
                    hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only 
                    begotten Son of God. (<span class="comm">The name "Jesus" means Saviour; to 
                        disbelieve this name is to reject Christ as Saviour. Verses 14 and 15 require belief in Jesus as the Son of man. 
                        This verse requires belief in him as the Son of God. Belief in this dual nature 
                        of Jesus is essential to salvation. Unbelief is the world's crowning sin; and 
                        belief is, humanly speaking, the source of its justification. The verse teaches 
                        that God's judgments are in a state of perpetually present enactment. The 
                        believer is saved now (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 13: 39</span></span>), 
                        and the unbeliever rests already under that condemnation which he fears the Son 
                        of God may some day pronounce against him.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And this is the judgment, 
                    that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the 
                    light; for their works were evil. 

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> For every one that doeth evil 
                    hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be 
                    reproved. 

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that 
                    his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God. (<span class="comm">These 
                        verses show that when God judges a man by his faith, the judgment is not 
                        arbitrary and irrational. Men believe according to the secret 
                        aspirations and desires of their nature. Christ, as the example and model of 
                        life, shines out as the light of the world; those who approve and love such a 
                        life are drawn to him and constrained to believe in him. Spiritually, they 
                        abide in his presence, that they may compare their lives with his, and that 
                        they may be assured that their works are 

                        wrought under the 
                        renewing and sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit, who is sent of Christ. 
                        But one whose desires are evil shrinks from Christ, and struggles to disbelieve 
                        in him: he seeks to know as little of Christ as possible, because such 
                        knowledge exposes the wickedness and depravity of his own sinful nature.</span>)
