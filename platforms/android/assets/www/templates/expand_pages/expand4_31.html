        <h3>31. HEALING A DEMONIAC.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">AT CAPERNAUM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MARK 1: 21-28;  LUKE 4: 31-37.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span>     And they (<span class="comm">Jesus and the four fishermen whom he 
                called</span>) go into {he came down to} Capernaum, a 
            city of Galilee. (<span class="comm">Luke has just spoken of Nazareth, and he uses the 
                expression "down to Capernaum" because the latter was on the lake 
                shore while Nazareth was up in the mountains.</span>) And  
            straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. {
            was teaching them} </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span>    And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them 
            as having {his word was with}  
            authority, and not as the scribes. (<span class="comm">Mark uses the adverb 
                "straightway" and the particle "again" (<span class="comm">which has a 
                    similar meaning</span>) to depict the rapid movement of Jesus. As used by him in this 
                connection it probably indicates that this was the next Sabbath after the 
                calling of the four fishermen. The astonishment of the people was natural. Not 
                yet recognizing Jesus' divinity, they could not understand how one so humble 
                could speak with such authority. They contrasted his teaching with that of the 
                scribes. The scribes were learned men who preserved, copied and expounded the 
                law and the tradition (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ezekiel 7: 6, 12; Nehemiah 8: 1; Matthew 15: 1-6; 23: 2-4; Mark 12: 35; Luke 11: 52 </span></span>). They were also called "lawyers" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 12: 28; Matthew 22: 35</span></span>), and "doctors of the law" 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 5: 17-21</span></span>). Though the 
                teaching of Jesus differed from the teaching of the scribes as to matter,
                the contrast drawn is as to manner. They spoke on the authority of 
                Moses or the elders, but Jesus taught by 

                his own authority. Their 
                way was to quote minute precedents supported by endless authorities. A passage 
                taken from later rabbinical writings starts thus: "Rabbi Zeira says, on 
                the authority of Rabbi Jose bar Rabbi Chanina, and Rabbi Ba or Rabbi Chija on 
                the authority of Rabbi Jochanan," etc. Contrast this with the 
                oft-repeated "I say to you" of Jesus--<span class="style7">Matthew 5: 18, 20, 22, 26, 28, 34.</span></span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span>   And straightway there 
            was in their {the}  synagogue 
            a man with {that had}  an 
            unclean spirit {a spirit of an unclean demon} 
            (<span class="comm">Matthew, Luke and Mark all concur in pronouncing demons unclean; that is, 
                wicked. They thus corrected the prevailing Greek notion that some of the demons 
                were good. The word "demon," as used in our Saviour's time by both 
                Jews and Greeks, meant the spirits of the departed or the ghosts of dead men, 
                and the teaching of that and prior ages was that such spirits often took 
                possession of living men and controlled them. But whatever these demons were, 
                the Scripture, both by its treatment of them and its words concerning them, 
                clearly indicates that they were immaterial, intelligent beings, which are 
                neither to be confused with maladies and diseases of the body, nor with tropes, 
                metaphors, or other figures of speech. In proof of this we adduce the following 
                Scripture facts: 1, the legislation of the Old Testament proceeded upon the 
                assumption that there was such a thing as a "familiar spirit" 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 19: 31</span></span>); 2, in the New Testament 
                they are spoken of as personalities (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 2: 19; Rev. 16: 14</span></span>), Jesus even founding a parable upon their habits 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 11: 24-26</span></span>); 3, Jesus 
                distinguished between them and diseases, and so did his disciples (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10: 8; Luke 10: 17-20</span></span>); 4, Jesus 
                addressed them as persons, and they answered as such (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 5: 8; 9: 25</span></span>); 5, they manifested desires and passions 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 5: 12, 13</span></span>); 6, they showed a 
                superhuman knowledge of Jesus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 8: 
                        29</span></span>). It would be impossible to regard demon possession as a mere 
                disease without doing violence to the language used in every instance of the 
                expulsion of a demon. The frequency of demoniacal possession in the time of 
                Jesus is probably due to the fact that his advent 

                formed a great 
                crisis in the spiritual order of things. For fuller treatment of the subject, 
                see Millennial Harbinger, 1841, pp. @457, @580; 1842, pp. @65, @124</span>)
            ; and he cried out,  with a loud voice (<span class="comm">The 
                man cried, the unclean spirit determined what he should cry. The silence and 
                decorum of the synagogue made the outcry more noticeable, and the demon 
                betrayed his excitement and alarm in speaking before he was spoken to</span>), 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span>    saying,</p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 34</span>   Ah! what have we to do with thee (<span class="comm">for explanation of this idiom see page 
                116</span>), Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? (<span class="comm">Jesus 
                came to destroy the works of the devil (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 3: 8</span></span>). At his second coming the workers themselves 
                shall suffer (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 25: 41</span></span>). We find 
                that they recognized that the time of this "torment" had not yet 
                come--<span class="style7">Matthew 8: 29.</span></span>) I know 
            thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. (<span class="comm">It is impossible that fever or 
                disease, mental or physical, could give such supernatural knowledge. The demon 
                called Jesus the Holy One, 1, because it was one of his proper Scriptural names 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalms 16: 10; Acts 3: 14</span></span>); 2, because 
                holiness was that characteristic which involved the ruin of demons as unholy 
                ones--just as light destroys darkness. We should note here the unfruitful 
                knowledge, faith, and confession of demons. They lacked neither knowledge 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 8: 29</span></span>), nor faith (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 2: 19</span></span>), nor did they withhold confession; 
                but Jesus received them not. Repentance and willing obedience are as necessary 
                as faith or confession.</span>) </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span>    Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and 
            come out of him. (<span class="comm">We have in this phrase two personages indicated by the 
                personal pronoun "him"; one of whom is commanded to come out of the 
                other; one of whom is now rebuked and hereafter to be destroyed, the other of 
                whom is delivered. In commanding silence Jesus refused to receive the demon's 
                testimony. We can see at least three reasons for this: 1, it was not fitting 
                that the fate of the people should rest upon the testimony of liars; 2, because 
                receiving such testimony might have been taken as an indication that Jesus 
                sustained friendly relations to demons--something which the enemies of 

                Christ actually alleged (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 12: 24</span></span>); 3, the Messiahship of Jesus was to be gradually unfolded, and 
                the time for its public proclamation had not yet come.</span>) And when the demon 
            {unclean spirit}  had thrown 
            him down in the midst,  tearing him and crying with a 
            loud voice,  he came out of him, having done him no 
            hurt. (<span class="comm">The demon first racked the body of the man with a convulsion, and 
                then, with a cry of rage, came out. All this was permitted that, 1, there might 
                be clear evidence of demoniacal possession; 2, the demon's malignity might be 
                shown; 3, it might be manifested that the spirit came not out of its own 
                accord, but because compelled thereto by the command of Christ. The cry was, 
                however, a mere impotent expression of anger, for Luke, "the beloved 
                physician," notes that it did the man no hurt.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 27</span>   And they were all amazed, {amazement came upon 
            all},  insomuch that they questioned among 
            themselves,  and they spake together, one with another, 
            saying,  What thing is this?  
            What is this word?  a new teaching!  
            for with authority and power he commandeth  even 
            the unclean spirits,  and they come out.and they obey him. (<span class="comm">The power to command disembodied spirits 
                thus amazed the people, because it was more mysterious than the power to work 
                physical miracles. By this miracle Jesus demonstrated his actual possession of 
                the authority which he had just assumed in his teaching.</span>) 
        </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span>   And the report 
            of him went out straightway  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 37</span>   (<span class="comm">And 
                there went forth a rumor concerning him}  everywhere 
                into all {every place of}  
                the region of Galilee roundabout. (<span class="comm">This fame was occasioned both by the 
                    miracle and the teaching. The benevolence and publicity of the miracle, and its 
                    power--the power of one mightier than Satan--would cause excitement 
                    in any community, in any age. Though this is the first miracle recorded by 
                    either Mark or Luke, yet neither asserts that it was the first miracle 
                    Jesus wrought, so there is no conflict with <span class="style7">John 2: 11.</span></span>)
