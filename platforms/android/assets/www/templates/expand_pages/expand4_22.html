        <h3>JESUS CLEANSES THE TEMPLE.</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 2.13-25.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And he found in the temple 
            (<span class="comm">Our English word "temple" includes two Greek words; namely, 1. The 
                naos, or 

                sanctuary--the small structure which 
                contained the holy and most holy places, and which answered to the tabernacle 
                used in the wilderness. 2. The heiron, or entire court space which 
                surrounded the naos, and which included some nineteen acres. The 
                heiron was divided into four courts, and as one entered toward the 
                naos from the east, he passed successively through them, as follows: 1, 
                Court of the Gentiles; 2, of the women; 3, of Israel; 4, of the priests. It was 
                in this outer or Gentiles' court that the markets described in this section 
                were held</span>) Those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of 
            money sitting (<span class="comm">This market in the temple was for the convenience of the 
                people, and the nearness of the passover increased its size. Oxen and doves 
                were constantly needed for sacrificial purposes, and as each family which ate 
                the passover required a lamb, they would be in the market in great abundance. 
                Josephus tells us it required about two hundred thousand lambs for the passover 
                feast, but his exaggerations will stand a liberal discount</span>):  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> and 
            he made a scourge of cords, and cast all (<span class="comm">The rest of the verse shows that 
                "all" does not refer to men, but to sheep and oxen. The scourge was 
                used in driving them out</span>) out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; 
            and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables (<span class="comm">The Jews 
                were each required to pay, for the support of the temple service, one 
                half-shekel annually (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 30: 13; Matthew 17: 
                        24</span></span>). These money-changers sat at small tables, on which their coins 
                were piled and counted</span>);</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> and to them that sold the doves he said, 
            Take these things hence (<span class="comm">As the doves were in cages of wicker-work, they 
                could not be driven out; hence Jesus called upon their owners to remove them. 
                Though Jesus cleansed the house, he wrought no waste of property. The sheep and 
                oxen were safe outside the temple, the scattered money could be gathered from 
                the stone pavement, and the doves were not set free from their cages</span>); 
            make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. (<span class="comm">Jesus bases his 
                peculiar authority over the temple on his peculiar relationship to Him for whom 
                the temple was built. 

                As a Son, he purged the temple of his 
                Father. In the beginning of his ministry he contested their right to thus 
                appropriate his Father's house to their uses, but in the end of his ministry he 
                spoke of the temple as "your house" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 23: 38</span></span>), thereby indicating that the people had taken unto 
                themselves that which truly belonged to God, even as the wicked husbandmen 
                appropriated the vineyard (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 20: 14, 
                        15</span></span>). The rebuke of Jesus was addressed to the priests, for the 
                market belonged to them, and the money-changers were their agents. Edersheim 
                says that this traffic alone cleared the priests about three hundred thousand 
                dollars a year. Though churches differ widely from the temple, they are still 
                God's houses, and should not be profaned. Religion should not be mixed with 
                traffic, for traffic tends toward sin. Phariseeism is its fruit--a wish to 
                carry on profitable business, even with God. On this occasion Jesus objected to 
                the use of the temple for trade without criticising the nature of the trade. 
                When he purged the temple three years later, he branded the traders as 
                robbers--<span class="style7">Matthew 21: 13</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> His 
            disciples remembered that it was written (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 69: 9</span></span>), Zeal for (<span class="comm">loving concern for</span>) thy house 
            shall eat me up. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, 
            What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? (<span class="comm">The 
                Jews felt that only a divinely commissioned person could thus interfere with 
                the ordering of God's house. They therefore called upon Jesus to give them a 
                sign as an evidence that he possessed such divine commission. The manner in 
                which he had cleansed the house of its trafficers was of itself a sign, if they 
                had only had eyes to see it. Jesus could not have thus cleansed the temple 
                unaided had he been a mere man. The power which he showed in the temple was 
                much like that which he manifested in Gethsemane--<span class="style7">John 18: 6</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, 
            Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. (<span class="comm">John here 
                records this saying, and Matthew (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 26: 61</span></span>) and Mark (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 14: 58</span></span>) tells 
                us how at the trial it was twisted into a charge against Christ; thus the 
                Evangelists supplement each other. 

                For the temple in this sentence 
                uses the word "naos," or sanctuary, the structure which was 
                peculiarly the seat of God's presence. The sanctuary was a figure or symbol of 
                the body of Christ, and the words of Jesus were a covert prediction that as 
                they were desecrating the symbol so would they destroy his body, which it 
                symbolized. They reverenced the Spirit of God neither as it dwelt in the 
                sanctuary nor as it dwelt in the body of Christ. The body of Jesus was a temple 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Colossians. 2: 9</span></span>), and Christians and the 
                church are also temples (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 3: 16, 17; 6: 
                        19; 2 Corinthians 5: 1; 2 Peter 1: 13</span></span>). God's temples can not be 
                permanently destroyed. They are "raised up."</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building (<span class="comm">The temple which then stood upon Mt. Moriah was the third structure which had occupied that site. The first temple, built by Solomon (<span class="comm">B.C. 1012-1005</span>), was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. The second temple, built by Zerubbabel and Jeshua (<span class="comm">B.C. 520</span>), had been torn down and rebuilt by Herod the Great, but in such a manner as not to interfere with the temple service. The sanctuary was completed in one year and a half, while the courts required eight years. Josephus says eighteen thousand workmen were employed in its erection. Additional outbuildings and other work had been carried on from that time, and the whole was not completed until A.D. 64</span>), and wilt thou raise it up in three days? (<span class="comm">To put before him the difficulty of what he apparently proposed to do, they merely mention one item--time. They say nothing of the army of workmen, nothing of a variety and cost of material, nothing of the skill required in the process of construction. How impossible seemed his offer! Yet by no means so impossible as that real offer which they misunderstood. A man might rear a temple in three days, but, apart from Christ Jesus, self-resurrection is unknown to history.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5"> 21</span> But he spake of the 
            temple of his body (<span class="comm">John differs from the other three Evangelists, in that 
                he frequently comments upon the facts which he records. Both history and 
                commentary are inspired.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> When therefore he was raised from the dead, 
            his 

            disciples remembered that he spake this (<span class="comm">It was 
                three years before they understood this saying. Thus truth often lies dormant 
                for years before it springs up in the heart and bears fruit--<span class="style7">1 Corinthians 15: 58; Ecclesiastes 11: 1</span></span>); and 
            they believed the scripture (<span class="comm">several passages foretell the 
                resurrection--<span class="style7">Psalm 16: 9, 10; 68: 
                    18</span></span>), and the word which Jesus had said. (<span class="comm">They believed 
                that Jesus had meant to predict that the Jews would kill him, and that he would 
                rise again on the third day.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the 
            passover, during the feast (<span class="comm">the seven days' feast of unleavened 
                bread--see <span class="style7">Leviticus 23: 5, 6</span></span>), 
            many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did. (<span class="comm">We have no 
                description of the miracles wrought at this time. See--<span class="style7"> John 4: 45; 20: 30</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> But Jesus did not trust himself 
            unto them, for that he knew all men (<span class="comm">The word here translated 
                "trust" is the same as that translated "believe" in the 
                preceding verse. They trusted him, but 
                he did not trust them, for he knew them. He did not tell them anything of his 
                plans and purposes, and the conversation with Nicodemus which follows is a 
                sample of this reticence</span>), </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> and because he needed not that any one 
            should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man. 
            (<span class="comm">John gives us many examples of this supernatural knowledge which Jesus 
                possessed. See--<span class="style7">John 1: 42, 47, 48; 3: 3; 4: 29; 6: 
                    61, 64; 11: 4, 14; 13: 11; 21: 17</span>. This chapter itself gives us a 
                faithful picture of "what was in man." We find in it temple, 
                profaners, money-makers, sign-seekers, opposers of reform, false and weak 
                professors of faith, etc., but none to whom Jesus could trust himself.</span>)</p>
