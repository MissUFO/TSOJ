        <h3>(<span class="comm">FRIDAY. TOWARD SUNRISE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 27: 15-30;  MARK 15: 6-19;  <br>
            LUKE 23: 13-25; JOHN 18: 39-19: 16.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 15</span> Now at the feast (<span class="comm">the passover and unleavened 
                bread</span>) the governor was wont {used to} release 
            unto them  the multitude one prisoner, whom they would. 
            {whom they asked of him.} (<span class="comm">No one knows when or 
                by whom this custom was introduced, but similar customs were not unknown 
                elsewhere, both the Greeks and Romans being wont to bestow special honor upon 
                certain occasions by releasing prisoners.</span>) </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> And 
            they had then  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 7</span> And there wasa notable prisoner,  one called 
            Barabbas, lying bound with them 
            that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed 
            murder. (<span class="comm">Josephus tells us that there had been an insurrection 
                against Pilate's government about that time caused by his taking money from the 
                temple treasury for the construction of an aqueduct. This may have been the 
                affair here referred to, for in it many lost their lives.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And the 
            multitude went up and began to ask him to do
            as he was wont to do unto them. (<span class="comm">It was still early in the 
                morning, and the vast majority of the city of Jerusalem did not know what was 
                transpiring at Pilate's palace. But they came thither in throngs, demanding 
                their annual gift of a prisoner. Pilate welcomed the demand as a possible 
                escape from his difficulties.</span>)  </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 13</span> And Pilate 
            called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people (<span class="comm">He did not 
                wish to seem to take advantage of our Lord's accusers by releasing him during 
                their absence. Possibly he knew of the triumphal entry the Sunday previous, and 
                thought that the popularity of Jesus would be such that his release would be 
                overwhelmingly demanded, and so called the rulers that they might see that he 
                had released Jesus in answer to popular clamor. If he had such expectations, 
                they were misplaced</span>), </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 9</span> And</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 17</span> When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate answered them, saying, {<span class="style5">Luke 23: 14</span> and said} unto them, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 15</span> no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; 
            and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 39</span> But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one 
            at the passover: </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 16</span> I will 
            therefore chastise him, and release him.  Will ye 
            therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  
            Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called 
            Christ? </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 18</span> For he knew {perceived}  that for envy they  
            the chief priests had delivered him up. (<span class="comm">Though Jesus had been declared 
                innocent on the joint finding of himself and Herod, Pilate did not 
                have the courage to deliberately release him. He sought to please the rulers by 
                scourging him, and the multitude by delivering him to them as a popular 
                favorite, and himself by an adroit escape from an unpleasant situation. But he 
                pleased nobody.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 18</span> But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:-- </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> 
            one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for 
            murder, was cast into prison. (<span class="comm">We see from Matthew's account that though 
                the people had a right to name their prisoner, Pilate took upon himself the 
                liberty of choosing which one of two it should be. By doing so he complicated 
                matters for the Jewish rulers, asking them to choose between Jesus, who was 
                held on an unfounded charge of insurrection, and Barabbas, who was notoriously 
                an insurrectionist and a murderer and a robber as well. But the rulers were not 
                to be caught in so flimsy a net. Without regard to consistency, they raised 
                their voice in full chorus for the release of Barabbas and the crucifixion of 
                Jesus.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 19</span> And while he was sitting on the 
            judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with 
            that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because 
            of him. (<span class="comm">This message of Pilate's wife suggests that the name and face of 
                Jesus were not unknown to Pilate's household. Pilate would be much influenced 
                by such a message. The Romans generally were influenced by all presages, and 
                Suetonius tells us that both Julius and Augustus C&aelig;sar attached much 
                importance to dreams.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 11</span> But </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 20</span> Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded {  stirred up} the multitude, {multitudes}  that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.  that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> But the governor answered and said unto them, 
            Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 18: 40</span> They cried out therefore again, saying, 
            Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 20</span> And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release 
            Jesus; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 12</span> And Pilate again answered and said {saith} unto them, What then shall 
            I do unto Jesus who is called Christ?  him whom ye call 
            the King of the Jews? </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 23: 21</span> but {<span class="style5">Mark 15: 13</span> and} they cried out {shouted} again, saying, Crucify, crucify him. They all say, Let him be crucified.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 14</span> And Pilate said unto them,  the third time, Why, 
            what evil hath this man {he} done?  
            I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and 
            release him.  But they cried out exceedingly, 
            saying,  Crucify him.  Let him 
            be be crucified. (<span class="comm">Finding the mob cruelly persistent, Pilate boldly 
                declines to do its will and turns back into the Pr&aelig;torium declaring his 
                intention to release Jesus. But he retires with the demands of the multitude 
                ringing in his ears.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 1</span> Then Pilate therefore took 
            Jesus, and scourged him. (<span class="comm">Carrying out the program which he proposed, 
                Pilate had Jesus removed from the Pr&aelig;torium to the place of scourging, 
                and inflicted that punishment upon him. We learn from Josephus and others that 
                the law required that those about to be crucified should first be scourged. But 
                Pilate hoped that scourging would suffice. He believed that the more moderate 
                would take pity upon Jesus when they viewed his scourged body, for scourging 
                was so cruel a punishment that the condemned person often died under its 
                infliction. The scourge was made of thongs loaded at the extremity with pieces 
                of bone or metal. The condemned person was stripped and fastened to a low post, 
                this bending the back so as to stretch the skin. Blood spurted at the first 
                blow.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, 
            and arrayed him in a purple garment; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> and they came unto him, and 
            said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands. (<span class="comm">The 
                soldiers had no special malice against Jesus, but the Roman military system 
                made men hard of heart. The occasion gave to these foreign legionaries a 
                much-enjoyed opportunity to show their contempt for the Jews by mocking Jesus 
                as their King. It is not known which one of the many thorny plants of Palestine 
                was used to form the Lord's crown. See p. 330. The robe was 
                designed to give Jesus a mock appearance of royalty, and it was likely some 
                cast-off military coat or state garment of Pilate's. Pilate winked at the 
                conduct of his soldiers since it favored his plan. If Jesus could be made 
                sufficiently pitiable and contemptible, his enemies might relent. But Pilate 
                little understood the venom of those enemies: they mocked and taunted Jesus 
                upon the cross.</span>)</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I 
            bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him. (<span class="comm">Those 
                having our modern sense of justice would have said that Pilate brought Jesus 
                out thus because he had found no crime in him. But scourging was little 
                thought of in that place and day (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 22: 24</span></span>). If Pilate had found Jesus guilty, he would have condemned him 
                at once. As it was, he sought to return Jesus to the Sanhedrin as having 
                committed no crime of which the Roman law could take note.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> Jesus 
            therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And
            Pilate saith unto them, Behold, the 
            man! (<span class="comm">It was Pilate's original proposition to scourge Jesus and let him go (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 16</span></span>). Having already 
                scourged him, he now hoped to effect his release. Presenting our Lord in this 
                state of abject humiliation, he feels that he has removed him from every 
                suspicion of royalty. He speaks of Jesus as no longer a king, but a mere man. 
                Pilate's words, however, have a prophetic color, somewhat like those uttered by 
                Caiaphas. All those of subsequent ages have looked and must continue to look to 
                Jesus as the ideal of manhood. The "Ecce Homo" of Pilate is in some 
                sense an echo of the words of the Father when he said, "This is my Son, 
                my chosen: hear ye him." In Jesus we behold the true man, the second 
                Adam.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they 
            cried out, saying, Crucify him, 
            crucify him! (<span class="comm">Thus Pilate's 
                expectation came to naught, for not one of the Jewish rulers ever wavered in 
                their demand for crucifixion.</span>) Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, 
            and crucify him: for I find no 
            crime in him. (<span class="comm">In this 
                sentence, "ye" and "I" are both emphatic; for Pilate 
                wishes to draw a contrast between himself and the Jewish rulers. His words are 
                not a permission to crucify, but a bit of taunting irony, as if he said: 
                "I the judge have found him innocent, but ye seem to lack the wit to see 
                that the case is ended. If ye are so much superior to the judge that ye can 
                ignore his decision, proceed without him; crucify him yourselves."</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because 
            he made himself the Son of God. (<span class="comm">Perceiving that Pilate was taunting them, 
                and practically accusing them of attempting to put an innocent man to death, 
                they defended themselves by revealing the fact that in addition to the charges 
                that they had preferred against Jesus, they had found him clearly guilty and 
                worthy of death on another charge; viz.: that of blasphemy (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 24: 16</span></span>). They had made no mention of this 
                fact because Pilate was under no obligation to enforce their law; but they 
                mentioned it now to justify their course. They probably felt sure that Jesus 
                himself would convince Pilate of the truth of this latter accusation if Pilate 
                questioned him.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more 
            afraid (<span class="comm">The words of Jesus at <span class="style7">John 18: 37</span> (<span class="comm">see p. 707</span>) and the message 
                from his wife had already filled Pilate with fear, and this saying added to it 
                because the Roman and Grecian mythologies told of many incarnations; and, 
                influenced by the calm presence of Jesus, Pilate readily considered the 
                possibility of such a thing</span>); </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> and he entered into the Praetorium 
            again (<span class="comm">taking Jesus with him for private examination</span>), and saith 
            unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. (<span class="comm">Pilate sought 
                to know whether Jesus were of heaven or of earth; but Jesus did not answer, for 
                the motive of the question was not right. Pilate did not wish an answer that he 
                might give or withhold worship; but that he might know how strenuously he 
                should defend Jesus. But innocent life is to be defended at all hazards, and it 
                matters not whether it be human or divine. Pilate, therefore, already knew 
                enough to enable him to discharge his duties.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> Pilate 
            therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I 
            have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee? (<span class="comm">Pilate 
                intimates that Jesus should treat his questions with more courtesy since his 
                good will and favor are not to be despised. But the words lay bare the corrupt 
                heart of Pilate, and form a prophecy of the sin which he committed. Judges must 
                hear and give sentence according to truth, uninfluenced by good will or favor. 
                But Pilate, to please the Jews, crucified Jesus, reversing the sentence which 
                he here suggests that he might render to please Jesus.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> Jesus answered 
            him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from 
            above: therefore he (<span class="comm">Caiaphas</span>) that delivered me unto thee hath greater 
            sin. (<span class="comm">Judas is spoken of as having delivered Jesus <span class="style7">John 18: 2, 5</span> (<span class="comm">the same word being translated 
                    both "betrayed" and "delivered"</span>), but Judas did not 
                deliver to Pilate, so Caiaphas as the representative of the Sanhedrin is here 
                meant; and Pilate's sin is contrasted with that of the rulers. Both of them 
                sinned in abusing their office (<span class="comm">the power derived from above <span class="style7">Psalm 75: 6, 7; Isaiah 44: 28; Romans 13: 1</span></span>); but 
                Pilate's sin stopped here. He had no acquaintance with Jesus to give him the 
                possibility of other powers--those of love or hatred, worship or 
                rejection. The members of the Sanhedrin had these powers which arose from a 
                personal knowledge of Jesus, and they abused them by hating and rejecting him, 
                thereby adding to their guilt. Pilate condemned the innocent when brought 
                before him, but the Sanhedrin searched out and arrested the innocent that they 
                might enjoy condemning him.</span>)   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> Upon this Pilate sought to release him 
            (<span class="comm">As we have seen, Pilate had before this tried to win the consent of the rulers 
                that Jesus be released, but that which John here indicates was probably an 
                actual attempt to set Jesus free. He may have begun by unloosing the hands of 
                Jesus, or some such demonstration</span>): but the Jews cried out, saying, 
            If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one that maketh 
            himself a king speaketh against Caesar. 
            (<span class="comm">Whatever Pilate's 
                demonstration was it was immediately met by a counter one on the part of the 
                rulers. They raise a cry which the politic Pilate can not ignore. Taking up the 
                political accusation (<span class="comm">which they had never abandoned</span>), they give it a new turn 
                by prompting Pilate to view it from C&aelig;sar's standpoint. Knowing the 
                unreasoning jealousy, suspicion and cruelty of the emperor, Pilate saw at once 
                that these unscrupulous Jews could make out of the present occasion a charge 
                against him which would cost him his position, if not his life.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> When 
            Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the 
            judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
            (<span class="comm">Pilate had already again and again declared Jesus innocent. He now mounts the 
                judgment-seat that he may formally reverse himself and condemn him. The apostle 
                as an eye-witness fixes by its two names the exact spot where this awful 
                decision was rendered.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> Now it was the Preparation of the passover 
            (<span class="comm">see p. 647</span>): it was about the sixth hour. (<span class="comm">It is likely that 
                John uses the Roman method of counting time, and means six A. M. See p. 142. 
                John notes also the exact hour day and hour.</span>) And he saith unto the Jews, 
            Behold, your King! (<span class="comm">As he had tried to waken their compassion by saying, 
                "Behold, the man!" so he now made a final attempt to shame them by 
                saying, "Behold, your King!"</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>  They therefore cried out, Away 
            with him, away with him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, 
            Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but 
            Caesar. (<span class="comm">Carried away by the strong emotions of the moment, the official 
                organs of the Jewish theocracy proclaimed C&aelig;sar to be their only king, 
                thus yielding with Jesus their claims to independence and their hopes in a 
                Messiah. This is a most significant fact. When their ancestors rejected Jehovah 
                as their king (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Samuel 12: 12</span></span>), their 
                faithful prophet, Samuel, warned them what the king of their choice would do, 
                and what they should suffer under him. Thus Jesus also foretold what this 
                C&aelig;sar of their choice would do to them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 19: 41-44; 23: 27-31</span></span>). They committed 
                themselves to the 
                tender mercies of Rome, and one generation later 
                Rome trod them in the wine-press of her wrath.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 23</span> But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And 
            their voices prevailed. (<span class="comm">They overcame Pilate's weak resistance by their 
                clamor.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> So when Pilate saw that he prevailed 
            nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his 
            hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this 
            righteous man; see ye to it. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. (<span class="comm">Pilate's 
                act was symbolic, intended to show that he regarded the crucifixion of Jesus as 
                a murder, and therefore meant to wash his hands of the guilt thereof. The 
                Jewish law made the act perfectly familiar to the Jews (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 21: 1-9</span></span>). Had the Jewish rulers not been 
                frenzied by hatred, the sight of Pilate washing his hands would have checked 
                them; but in their rage they take upon themselves and their children all the 
                responsibility. At the siege of Jerusalem they answer in part for the blood of 
                Christ, but God alone determines the extent of their responsibility, and he 
                alone can say when their punishment shall end. But we know that it ends for all 
                when they repentantly seek his forgiveness. The punishments of God are not 
                vindictive, they are the awards of Justice meted out by a merciful hand.</span>)</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 15</span> And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude,
            gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 26</span> Then released he unto them 
            Barabbas;  him that for insurrection and murder had 
            been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their 
            will. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 19: 16</span> Then thereforeJesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified (<span class="comm">Mark 
                mentions the scourging to show that it preceded the crucifixion, but we see 
                from John's account that the scourging took place somewhat earlier in the 
                proceeding</span>),  he delivered him unto them to be 
            crucified. (<span class="comm">Pilate delivered Jesus to their punishment, but not into their 
                hands; he was led forth and crucified by Pilate's soldiers, who first mocked 
                him, as the next paragraph shows.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 16</span> And </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 27</span> Then the soldiers of the governor took 
            Jesus,  led him away within {into} the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called togetherand gathered unto him the whole band. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 17</span> And they clothe him with purple,</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 29</span> And they platted {platting} a crown of thorns, 
            (<span class="comm">and</span>) they put it on him;  upon his head, and a reed 
            in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 18</span> and they began to salute him,  
            saying, Hail, King of the Jews! </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 27: 30</span> And they spat upon him, 
            and took the reed </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 15: 19</span> And they smote his 
            head {and smote him on the head.}  
            with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped 
            him. (<span class="comm">After the sentence of death the soldiers take Jesus back into the 
                Pr&aelig;torium, and renew the mockeries and indignities which had been 
                interrupted that Pilate might exhibit Jesus to the people, as John shows us. 
                Moreover, the whole band, or cohort, are now gathered, where at first but a few 
                took part. It is likely that the mock robe and crown were removed when Jesus 
                was brought before Pilate to be sentenced, for it is highly improbable that a 
                Roman judge would pronounce the death sentence while the prisoner was clothed 
                in such a manner.</span>)</p>
