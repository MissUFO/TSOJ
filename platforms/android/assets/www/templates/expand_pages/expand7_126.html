        <h3>126. THE FINAL JUDGMENT.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">MOUNT OF OLIVES. <br>TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 25: 1-46.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> Then (<span class="comm">i. e., at the time of the Lord's 
                coming. Jesus is still emphasizing the lesson of watchfulness, and proceeds to 
                enforce it by two parables</span>) shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 
            ten (<span class="comm">probably the usual number on such occasions</span>) virgins, who took 
            their lamps (<span class="comm">small earthenware vessels, with flax wicks, and without glass 
                chimneys</span>), and went forth to meet the bridegroom. (<span class="comm">The Oriental 
                wedding began with a feast in the house of the bride's father. After this the 
                bridegroom led the bride to his own home, and it was the duty of his servants 
                and household (<span class="comm">of whom the ten virgins in this case were part</span>) to honor him and 
                the bride with an enthusiastic welcome.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And five of them were foolish, 
            and five were wise. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> For the foolish, when they took their lamps, 
            took no oil with them: </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> but the wise took oil in their vessels 
            with their lamps. (<span class="comm">The foolish showed their folly in failing to provide for 
                their lord's delay. The oil in their lamps would only burn till about 
                midnight. But the wise had provided an additional supply to burn from then till 
                daylight.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and 
            slept. (<span class="comm">Rather, "nodded and slept." They did not lie down to 
                regular slumber, but took such innocent rest as their office permitted. Others 
                were on the lookout, and would give the warning; so these were permitted to 
                sleep, but only in such a posture that they would be ready to arise and go at 
                once when apprised of their lord's approach.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> But at midnight there is a 
            cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> Then all 
            those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> And the 
            foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going 
            out. (<span class="comm">The signal-call roused all ten, and each group of five prepared by 
                trimming the lamps, etc. But then became apparent the difference between them. 
                All had made some preparation, but that of the foolish five had been 
                insufficient. Their glory began to depart, and their light waned into darkness 
                at the approach of the bridegroom.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> But the wise answered, saying, 
            Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that 
            sell, and buy for yourselves. (<span class="comm">There will be no borrowed righteousness on 
                the day of the Lord's coming, for no one will have any to spare. The Roman 
                Catholic confidence in saints, and the trust of some Protestants in pious 
                parents, are alike unavailing: each soul must see to its own lamp. Those who 
                had the oil to sell are merely part of the drapery of the parable, put in to 
                bring out the point that it was then too late to secure any oil. The oil 
                of God's grace is given without money and without price, but in the hour of the 
                Lord's appearing it will be too late to seek for it.</span>)</p> 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> And while they went 
            away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to 
            the marriage feast: and the door was shut. (<span class="comm">The feast in the bridegroom's 
                house was considered the most important part of the marriage, and certainly for 
                those of the lord's own household it was the only feast. To be shut out from it 
                was to be deprived of all participation in the marriage joy. All the wisdom and 
                shrewdness of Universalism can never open this shut door.</span>)</p> 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> Afterward came 
            also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> But he 
            answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. (<span class="comm">The verb 
                "know" is here used, according to the Jewish idiom, for favorable 
                knowledge (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 7: 23</span></span>). It signified 
                that these virgins, on account of their remissness, were no longer counted even 
                as acquaintances, much less as part of the household.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> Watch therefore, 
            for ye know not the day nor the hour. (<span class="comm">Thus Jesus makes his own application 
                of the parable.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> For it is 
            as when a man, going into 


            another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto 
            them his goods. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And unto one he gave five talents, to another 
            two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on 
            his journey.</p> 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> Straightway he that received the five talents went 
            and traded with them, and made other five talents. (<span class="comm">The parable of the 
                virgins represented watchfulness displaying itself in waiting for the 
                Lord, while it is here displayed in working for him. There it was inward 
                spiritual life, here it is external activity.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> In like manner he also 
            that received the two gained 
            other two. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> But he that received the one went away and digged in 
            the earth, and hid his lord's money. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Now after a long time the 
            lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them. (<span class="comm">We have 
                here one of the Lord's intimations that the day of judgment would not come at 
                once. The word for servants is douloi, which means slaves. They were the 
                property of the master and he might dispose of them as he pleased. The 
                reckoning is as sure as the trust; judgment is as sure as life. A man who had 
                entrusted a talent (<span class="comm">from $1,600 to $1,800</span>) would surely not forget to ask a 
                settlement, nor will God fail to demand an accounting from all those to whom he 
                had entrusted the riches and privileges of this wonderful human life which he 
                has given us, though many of us may lightly esteem it.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And he that 
            received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, 
            thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou 
            hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter 
            thou into the joy of thy lord. (<span class="comm">The joy of the lord was doubtless some 
                festival in celebration of his return, and it stands for the joy of Christ in 
                the Father's house.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And he also that 
            received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst 
            unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> His 
            lord said unto him, Well done, 

            good and faithful servant: 
            thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; 
            enter thou into the joy of thy lord. (<span class="comm">The second servant, having done well 
                proportionately as the first, received the like precious commendation.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> 
            And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee 
            that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where 
            thou didst not scatter; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> and I was afraid, and went away and hid 
            thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> But his lord 
            answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that 
            I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> 
            thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I 
            should have received back mine own with interest. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> Take ye away 
            therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten 
            talents. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he 
            shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall 
            be taken away. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into 
            the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. 
            (<span class="comm">See pp. 565, 566. This parable is much like that of the pounds, but differs in 
                several particulars. There the same amount was entrusted to each one, 
                but the returns were different, and the rewards were different. Here 
                different amounts were entrusted, the returns were in proportion to the 
                trust, and the rewards were the same.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> But when the Son of man shall come 
            in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of 
            his glory (<span class="comm">Christ's judgment throne is called his throne of glory because 
                in the day that he sits upon it his glory will be exhibited to men more 
                brightly than ever before; for in the decisions of that hour his mercy, 
                justice, and righteousness will most fully appear, and all the obscure things 
                in the past administration of his government will be made clear</span>): </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> 
            and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he 

            shall separate them (<span class="comm">not the nations, but the individuals which compose 
                them</span>) one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the 
            goats (<span class="comm">It was the custom for the shepherd to let the sheep and goats feed 
                together during the day and to separate them at night. This custom is placed in 
                the parable because it is analogous to the present commingling and final 
                separation of men. Goats are here employed to represent the evil class of men, 
                because goats have to be driven while sheep follow the shepherd</span>); </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the 
            left. (<span class="comm">The right hand is always represented as the place of honor and 
                preferment. The Jews in their traditions say that when criminals were tried by 
                the Sanhedrin those who were acquitted were placed on the right hand, and those 
                who were condemned on the left.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> Then shall the King say unto them on his 
            right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit (<span class="comm">take possession of as 
                rightful heirs</span>) the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the 
            world (<span class="comm">God's purpose designed such a kingdom from the beginning (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 1: 9-14</span></span>), and we may conceive of it 
                as in process of preparation ever since--<span class="style7">John 14: 2</span></span>): </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was 
            thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, 
            and ye came unto me. (<span class="comm">The acts here enumerated indicate more than a mere 
                outlay of money. They are not such are the offspring of impulse, but such as 
                call for the sacrifice of time, strength, sympathy, etc., and clearly 
                demonstrate the fullness of the Christian life. Moreover, Jesus does not mean 
                to teach that mere works of benevolence are a sufficient ground for salvation. 
                The meaning is that none can be saved without these fruits of faith and 
                love. The passage must be construed in the light of other Scriptures which 
                teach the further necessity of forgiveness on the part of God and of obedience 
                on the part of man.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, 
            when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee 

            drink? </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> And when saw we thee a stranger, and took 
            thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> And when saw we thee sick, 
            or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> And the King shall answer and 
            say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these 
            my brethren, even these least, 
            ye did it unto me. (<span class="comm">This conversation is the drapery of the narrative. Such 
                words will not be actually spoken at the judgment, but they are introduced for 
                the twofold purpose of illustrating the beautiful unconsciousness of merit and 
                which characterizes the noblest of deeds and the more important fact that 
                anything done for his sake is the same as done for his person--<span class="style7">Matthew 10: 42; Mark 9: 41</span>.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> Then shall he 
            say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the 
            eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels (<span class="comm">The two 
                preparations stand in contrast. God prepared a kingdom of joy and designed that 
                man should be with him in it. He also prepared a place for punishment for Satan 
                and his angels, and man can cast his lot there and share that punishment if he 
                wills to do so</span>): </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; 
            I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span> I was a stranger, and 
            ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye 
            visited me not. </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when 
            saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, 
            and did not minister unto thee? </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> Then shall he answer them, 
            saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these 
            least, ye did it not unto me. (<span class="comm">The neglect or abuse of Christ's disciples 
                is a direct affront to his person--<span class="style7">Acts 9: 4</span>.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the 
            righteous into eternal life. (<span class="comm">This verse contains two important truths: 1. 
                That the doom of the wicked is as durable as the reward of the righteous. 2. 
                That the doom of the wicked is a punishment. The word "punishment" 
                expresses misery and suffering purosely inflicted.</span>)</p>
