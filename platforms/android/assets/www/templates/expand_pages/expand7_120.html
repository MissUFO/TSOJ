        <h3>120A. RULERS SEEK TO ENSNARE JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">COURT OF THE TEMPLE. TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>PHARISEES AND HERODIANS.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 22: 15-22;  MARK 12: 13-17; LUKE 20: 20-26.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5"></span> 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 22: 15</span> Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they 
            might ensnare him in his 
            talk.  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 20</span> And 
            they watched him, and sent forth {send unto him}
            their disciples,  certain of the 
            Pharisees and of {with}  the 
            Herodians, that they might catch him in talk. (<span class="comm">Perceiving that Jesus, when 
                on his guard, was too wise for them, the Pharisees thought it best to speak 
                their cunning through the mouths of their young disciples, whose youth and 
                apparent desire to know the truth would, according to their calculation, take 
                Jesus off his guard. Having no ancient statement giving us the tenets or 
                principles of the Herodians, we are left to judge them solely by their name, 
                which shows that they were partisans of Herod Antipas. Whether they were 
                out-and-out supporters of the Roman government, or whether they clung to Herod 
                as one whose intervening sovereignty saved them from the worse fate of being 
                directly under a Roman procurator (<span class="comm">as Jud&aelig;a and Samaria then were</span>), would 
                not, as some suppose, affect their views as to the payment of tribute. If they 
                accepted Herod merely for policy's sake, policy would also compel them to favor 
                the tribute, for Antipas, being appointed 

                by Rome, would have to 
                favor the tribute, and could count none as his adherents who opposed it.</span>) 
            spies, who feigned themselves to righteous (<span class="comm">sincere 
                seekers after truth</span>), that they might take hold of his speech, so as 
            to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor. 
            (<span class="comm">Pontius Pilate was the governor. We are not surprised at the destruction of 
                Jerusalem when we see the religious teachers of the nation employing their 
                young disciples in such a work as this. To play detective and entrap a rogue in 
                his speech and thus become a man-hunter is debasing enough; but to seek thus to 
                entrap a righteous man is simply diabolical.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 14</span> 
            And when they were come, they say unto him, {saying,} 
            Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly,  
            we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest 
            not the person of men,  and acceptest not the person
            of any, but of a truth teachest the 
            way of God:  in truth (<span class="comm">The meaning of their preface 
                is this: "We see that neither fear nor respect for the Pharisees or the 
                rulers prevents you from speaking the plain, disagreeable truth; and we are 
                persuaded that your courage and love of truth will lead you to speak the same 
                way in political matters, and that you will not be deterred therefrom by any 
                fear or reverence for C&aelig;sar." Fearless loyalty to truth is indeed 
                one of the noblest attributes of man. But instead of honoring this most 
                admirable quality in Jesus, these hardened reprobates were endeavoring to 
                employ it as an instrument for his destruction</span>), 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 22: 17</span> Tell us 
            therefore, What thinkest thou?  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 22</span> Is it 
            lawful for us to give tribute unto C&aelig;sar, or not? 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 15</span> Shall we give, or shall we not give? (<span class="comm">The Jews were 
                required to pay annually a large sum of money to the Roman government as an 
                acknowledgment of their subjection. About twenty years before this Judas of 
                Galilee had stirred up the people to resist this tribute, and the mass of the 
                Jews was bitterly opposed to it. To decide in favor of this tribute was 
                therefore to alienate the affection and confidence of the throng in the temple 
                who stood listening to him--an end most desirable to the Pharisees. If, 


                on the other hand, Jesus said that the tribute should not be paid, 
                the Herodians were present to hear it, and would be witnesses sanctioned by 
                Herod, and therefore such as Pilate would be compelled to respect. What but 
                divine wisdom could escape from so cunningly devised a dilemma!</span>) 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 22: 18</span> But Jesus perceived their wickedness,  
            craftiness,  knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, 
            {and said} Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?
            (<span class="comm">Thus, before answering, Jesus exposes the meanness and hypocrisy in their 
                question, thereby emphasizing the important fact that he did not dodge, but 
                answered it.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Show me the tribute money.  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 24</span> Show me a denarius.  bring me a denarius, 
            that I may see it. (<span class="comm">Religious dues and tributes had been paid in shekels or 
                old Jewish coin, but the tribute to Rome was paid in Roman coin of which the 
                denarius was a sample.</span>)   And they brought unto him a 
            denarius. (<span class="comm">See p. 376.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 22: 20</span> And he saith unto them, Whose is this image 
            and superscription?  Whose image and superscription 
            hath it? (<span class="comm">The little silver coin had the head of the emperor stamped upon 
                it, and the superscription TICAESARDIVIAVGFAVGVSTVS, which stands for the words 
                Tiberias C&aelig;sar, Divi Augusti Filius Augustus; i. e., Tiberius 
                C&aelig;sar, the August Son of the Divine Augustus.</span>) And they said, {
            say} unto him, C&aelig;sar's.  



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 17</span> And  Then  
            Jesus said {saith}  
            unto them,  Then render  
            therefore unto C&aelig;sar the things which are C&aelig;sar's; and unto God the 
            things that are God's. (<span class="comm">Each nation uses its own coin. Had the Jews not 
                been under Roman sovereignty, they would not have been using Roman money; but 
                the coin which they brought to Jesus bore witness against them that the Roman 
                sovereignty was established in their land, and that tribute to it was therefore 
                justly due; for whoso uses C&aelig;sar's coin must pay C&aelig;sar's tribute. 
                This part of the answer satisfied the Herodians; and the last part "and 
                unto God," etc., satisfied the people, for it asserted, in a manner which 
                carried conviction with it, that the payment of enforced tribute was not 
                inconsistent with maintaining complete allegiance of God. 

                God was 
                no longer, as of old, the civil ruler of his people, and hence the payment of 
                tribute to a temporal sovereign is in no sense incompatible with his service, 
                but is enjoined as a Christian duty--<span class="style7">Romans 13: 1, 7</span>.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 20: 26</span> And they were not able 
            to take hold of the saying before the people:  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 22: 22</span> And when they heard it, they marvelled,  
            greatly at him.  at his answer, and held their 
            peace.  and left him, and went away. (<span class="comm">They were 
                amazed to find how far his wisdom transcended that of the teachers in whom they 
                had such supreme confidence.</span>)
