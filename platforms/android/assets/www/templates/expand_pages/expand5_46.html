        <h3>46. MESSIANIC TEACHING.</h3>
        <h3>MATT. 5: 17-48;  LUKE 6: 27-30, 32-36.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span>  Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the 
            prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. (<span class="comm">This verse constitutes 
                a preface to the section of the sermon which follows it. It is intended to 
                prevent a misconstruction of what he was about to say. Destroy is here used in 
                antithesis, not with perpetuate, but with fulfill. To destroy the law would be 
                more than to abrogate it, for it was both a system of statutes designed for the 
                ends of government, and a system of types foreshadowing the kingdom of Christ. 
                To destroy it, therefore, would be both to abrogate its statutes 

                and prevent the fulfillment of its types. The former, Jesus eventually did; the 
                latter, he did not. As regards the prophets, the only way to destroy them would 
                be to prevent the fulfillment of the predictions contained in them. Instead of 
                coming to destroy either the law or the prophets, Jesus came to fulfill all the 
                types of the former, and (<span class="comm">eventually</span>) all the unfulfilled predictions of the 
                latter. He fulfills them partly in his own person, and partly by his 
                administration of the affairs of his kingdom. The latter part of the process is 
                still going on, and will be until the end of the world.</span>)




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> For verily I say 
            unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no 
            wise pass from the law, till all things be accomplished. (<span class="comm">The jot or yod 
                answering to our letter i was the smallest of the Hebrew letters. The 
                tittle was a little stroke of the pen, by which alone some of the Hebrew 
                letters were distinguished from others like them. To put it in English, we 
                distinguish the letter c from the letter e by the tittle inside 
                of the latter. This passage not only teaches that the law was to remain in full 
                force until fulfilled, but it shows the precise accuracy with which the law was 
                given by God.</span>)




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span>  Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least 
            commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of 
            heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the 
            kingdom of heaven. (<span class="comm">Disobedience is a habit, and it is not easily laid 
                aside. Hence he that is unfaithful in that which is little will also be 
                unfaithful in that which is great. So also those who were disobedient and 
                reckless under the Jewish dispensation would be inclined to act in like manner 
                in the new, or Christian, dispensation: hence the warning. Not only shall God 
                call such least, but men also shall eventually do likewise. Those who by a 
                false system of interpretation, or an undue regard for the traditions of men, 
                enervate or annul the obligations of Christ's laws or ordinances, and teach 
                others to do the same, shall be held in low esteem or contempt by the church or 
                kingdom of God as fast as it comes to a knowledge 

                of the truth. 
                Greatness in the kingdom of heaven is measured by conscientiousness in 
                reference to its least commandments. Small Christians obey the great 
                commandments, but only the large are careful about the least.</span>)




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. (<span class="comm">Since the scribes and Pharisees were models of righteousness in their own sight and in that of the people, Jesus here laid down a very high ideal. Though one may now enter the kingdom of heaven having of himself far less righteousness than that of the Pharisees, yet he must attain righteousness superior to theirs, or he can not abide in the kingdom. A large portion of the sermon from this point on is a development of the righteousness of the kingdom of heaven in contrast with old dispensation righteousness and Pharisaic interpretation of it. The laws of Moses regulated civil conduct, and being state laws, they could only have regard to overt acts. But the laws of the kingdom of Christ are given to the individual, and regulate his inner spiritual condition, and the very initial motives of conduct; in it the spirit-feelings are all acts--<span class="style7">1 John 3: 15</span>.</span>)




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> Ye have heard (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 20: 13; Deuteronomy 5: 17</span>. The common 
                people, for the most part, knew the law only by its public reading, and hence 
                the exposition of the scribes which accompanied the readings shared in their 
                estimation the very authority of Scripture itself.</span>) that it was said to them 
            of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in 
            danger (<span class="comm">shall be liable to</span>) of the judgment; 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca (<span class="comm">an expression of contempt frequently used in rabbinical writings, but of uncertain derivation, so that it may mean &quot;empty head&quot; or &quot;spit out;&quot; i. e., heretic</span>), shall be in danger of the council: and whosoever shall say, Thou fool (<span class="comm">&quot;'Thou impious wretch;' folly and impiety being equivalent with the Hebrews&quot;-- Bloomfield</span>), shall be in danger of hell fire. (<span class="comm">We have here three degrees of criminality or offence as to the sin of anger: 1. Silent rage; 2. Railing speech; 3. Bitter reproach (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 14: 1</span></span>). With these are associated respectively three different degrees of punishment. The law of Moses provided for the appointment of judges (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 16: 18</span></span>), and Josephus informs us that in each city there were seven 
                judges appointed (<span class="comm">Antiquities 4: 8, 14</span>). This tribunal was known as the judgment, and 
                by it the case of the manslayer was determined. Compare 
                <span class="style7">Numbers 35: 15, 24, 25</span> with <span class="style7">Joshua 20: 4</span>. And in determining his case this court might certify it for decision to the Sanhedrin, or they might themselves confine the man in of the cities of refuge, or order him to be stoned to death. The second punishment would be the result of a trial before the Sanhedrin or council. This chief court of the Jews sat at Jerusalem (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 17: 8-13</span></span>), and common 
                men stood in great awe of it. The third punishment passes beyond the pale of 
                human jurisdiction. It is the final punishment--being cast into hell. The 
                Scripture word for hell is derived from the name of a place in the neighborhood 
                of Jerusalem, called the valley of Hinnom. It was a deep, narrow valley, lying 
                southeast of Jerusalem. The Greek word Gehenna (<span class="comm">which we translate hell</span>) is 
                first found applied to it in the Septuagint translation of 
                <span class="style7">Joshua 18: 16</span>. (<span class="comm">For the history of the valley, 
                    see the following passages of Scripture: 
                    <span class="style7">Joshua 15: 8; 2 Chronicles 28: 3; 33: 6; Jeremiah 7: 31; 19: 1-5; 2 Kings 23: 1-14; 2 Chronicles 34: 4, 5</span>.</span>) The only fire certainly known to have been kindled there was the fire in which children were sacrificed to the god Moloch. This worship was entirely destroyed by King Josiah, who polluted the entire valley so as to make it an unfit place even for heathen worship. Some commentators endeavor to make this third punishment a temporal one, and assert that fires were kept burning in the valley of Hinnom, and that as an extreme punishment the bodies of criminals were cast into those fires. But there is not the slightest authentic evidence that any fire was kept burning there; nor is there any evidence at all that casting a criminal into the fire was ever employed by the Jews as a punishment. It was the fire of idolatrous worship in the offering of human sacrifice which had given the valley its bad name. This caused it to be associated in the mind of the Jews with sin and suffering, and led to the application of its name, in the Greek form of it, to the place of final and eternal punishment. When the conception of such a place as hell was formed, it was necessary to give it a name, and there was no word in the Jewish language more appropriate for the purpose than the name of this hideous valley. It is often used in the New Testament, and always denotes the place of final punishment (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10: 28; 18: 9; 23: 33; Mark 9: 43</span></span>). 
                We should note that while sin has stages, God takes note of it from its very 
                first germination in the heart, and that a man's soul is imperiled long before 
                his feelings bear their fruitage of violence and murder.</span>)



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> If therefore
            (<span class="comm">having forbidden anger, Jesus now proceeds to lay down the course for 
                reconciliation</span>) thou art offering thy gift at the altar (<span class="comm">that which was 
                popularly esteemed the very highest act of worship</span>), and there 
            rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span>  leave 
            there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy 
            brother, and then come and offer thy gift. (<span class="comm">Reconciliation takes precedence 
                of all other duties, even of offerings made to God. A very important teaching 
                in these days, when men, by corrupt practices, by extortionate combinations, 
                and by grinding the face of the poor, accumulate millions of dollars and then 
                attempt to placate God by bestowing a little of their pocket change upon 
                colleges and missionary societies. God hears and heeds the voice of the 
                unreconciled brethren, and the gift is bestowed upon the altar in vain. The 
                offering of unclean hands is an abomination. The lesson teaches us to be 
                reconciled with all who bear grudges against us, and says nothing as to whether 
                their reasons are sufficient or insufficient, just or unjust. "It is 
                enough to say, I have naught against him, and so justify 
                myself"--Stier.</span>) 




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Agree with thine adversary 
            (<span class="comm">opponent in a lawsuit</span>) 

            quickly, while thou art with him in the 
            way (<span class="comm">on the road to the judge</span>); lest haply thy adversary deliver 
            thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer [<span class="comm">one answering 
                somewhat to our sheriff</span>), and thou be cast into prison. 
            (<span class="comm">"In this brief allegory one is supposed to have an adversary at law who 
                has just cause against him, and who will certainly gain a verdict when the case 
                comes into court. The plaintiff himself used to apprehend the defendant" 
                (<span class="comm">Bengel</span>). The defendant is, therefore, advised to agree with this 
                adversary while the two are alone on the way to the judge, and thus prevent a 
                trial. Jesus still has in mind the preceding case of one who has given offence 
                to his brother. Every such one is going to the final judgment, and will there 
                be condemned unless he now becomes reconciled to his brother.</span>)



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span>  Verily I 
            say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the 
            last farthing. (<span class="comm">This is the text on which the Roman Catholic Church has 
                built its doctrine of purgatory, and one of those on which the Universalists 
                build theirs of final restoration. But neither "prison" nor 
                "till" necessarily point to ultimate deliverance. Compare 
                <span class="style7">2 Peter 2: 4</span> and <span class="style7">Jude 6</span>. The allusion here is of 
                course to imprisonment for debt. In such a case the debtor was held until the 
                debt was paid, either by himself or some friend. If it were not paid at all, he 
                remained in prison until he died. In the case which this is made to represent, 
                the offender would have let pass all opportunity to make reparation and no 
                friend can make it for him; therefore, the last farthing will never be paid, 
                and he must remain a prisoner forever. So far, therefore, from being a picture 
                of hope, it is one which sets forth the inexorable rigor of divine justice 
                against the hardened and impenitent sinner. It is intended to teach that men 
                can not pay their debts to God, and therefore they had better obtain his 
                forgiveness through faith during these days of grace. It exposes the vain hope 
                of those who think that God will only lightly exact his debts. God knows only 
                complete forgiveness or complete exaction. This is an action founded upon the 
                perfection of his nature. The Greek word 

                translated 
                "farthing," is derived from the Latin "quadrans," which 
                equals the fourth part of a Roman As, a small copper or bronze coin 
                which had become common in Palestine. The farthing was worth about one-fifth 
                part of a cent.</span>)




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> Ye have heard that it was said (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 20: 14; Deuteronomy 5: 18</span></span>), Thou shalt 
            not commit adultery: 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. (<span class="comm">Here, as in reference to murder, Jesus legislates against the thought which lies back of the act. He cuts off sin at its lowest root. The essence of all vice is intention. Those who indulge in unchaste imaginations, desires and intentions are guilty before God--<span class="style7">2 Peter 2: 14</span>. 



                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> And if thy right eye (<span class="comm">the organ of 
                        reception</span>) causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee 
                    (<span class="comm">these words indicate decision and determination, and suggest the conduct of a 
                        surgeon, who, to protect the rest of the body, unflinchingly severs the 
                        gangrened members</span>): for it is profitable for thee that one of thy 
                    members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. 



                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> And if thy right hand (<span class="comm">the instrument of outward action</span>) causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell. (<span class="comm">Jesus here emphasizes the earnestness with which men should seek a sinless life. To this the whole Scripture constrains us by the terrors of hell, and encourages us by the joys of heaven. The right eye and hand and foot were regarded as the most precious (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Zechariah 11: 17; Exodus 29: 20</span></span>), but it is better to lose the dearest thing in life than to lose one's self. To be deprived of all earthly advantage than to be cast into hell. Of course the Saviour does not mean that we should apply this precept literally, since bodily mutilation will not cure sin which resides in the will and not in the organ of sense or action. A literal exaction of the demands of this precept would turn the church into a hospital. We should blind ourselves by taking care not to look with evil eyes; we should maim ourselves by absolutely refusing to go to forbidden resorts, etc. &quot;'Mortify' (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Colossians 3: 5</span></span>) is a 
                        similar expression"--Bengel.</span>) 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span>  It is said also 
                    (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 24: 1, 3</span></span>), Whosoever 
                    shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: 



                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for 
                    the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress [<span class="comm">the mere fact of 
                        divorce did not make her an adulteress, but it brought her into a state of 
                        disgrace from which she invariably sought to free herself by contracting 
                        another marriage, and this other marriage to which her humiliating situation 
                        drove her made her an adulteress</span>]: and whosoever shall marry her when 
                    she is put away committeth adultery. (<span class="comm">The law of divorce will be found at <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 24: 1-4</span> Jesus explains that this law was given by Moses on account of the hardness of the people's heart; i. e., to prevent greater evils (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 19: 8</span></span>). The law permitted the husband to put away the wife when he found &quot;some unseemly thing in her.&quot; But Jesus here limits the right of divorce to cases of unchastity, and if there be a divorce on any other ground, neither the man nor the woman can marry again without committing adultery (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 19: 9</span></span>). Such is Jesus' 
                        modification of the Old Testament law, and in no part of the New Testament is 
                        there any relaxation as to the law here set forth. It is implied that divorce 
                        for unchastity breaks the marriage bond, and it is therefore held almost 
                        universally, both by commentators and moralists, that the innocent party to 
                        such a divorce can marry again. Of course the guilty part could not, for no one 
                        is allowed by law to reap the benefits of his own wrong. For further light on 
                        the subject, see 
                        <span class="style7">Romans 7: 1-3; 1 Corinthians 7: 10-16, 39</span>. It is much to be regretted that in many Protestant 
                        countries the civil authorities have practically set aside this law of Christ 
                        by allowing divorce and remarriage for a variety of causes. No man who respects 
                        the authority of Christ can take advantage of such legislation.</span>)



                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> Again, ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 19: 12; Numbers 30: 2; Deuteronomy 23: 21</span></span>): 



                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by

                    whatsoever is more than these is of the evil 
                    one. (<span class="comm">It will be seen from the quotation given by Jesus that the 
                        law permitted oaths made unto the Lord. It was not the intention of Jesus to 
                        repeal this law. But the Jews, looking upon this law, construed it as giving 
                        them exemption from the binding effect of all other oaths. According to the 
                        their construction no oath was binding in which the sacred name of God did not 
                        directly occur. They therefore coined many other oaths to suit their purposes, 
                        which would add weight to their statements or promises, which, however, would 
                        not leave them guilty of being forsworn if they spoke untruthfully. But Jesus 
                        showed that all oaths were ultimately referable to God, and that those who made 
                        them would be forsworn if they did not keep them. To prevent this evil practice 
                        of loose swearing Jesus lays down the prohibition, "Swear not at 
                        all;" but the universality of this prohibition is distributed by the 
                        specifications of these four forms of oaths, and is, therefore, most strictly 
                        interpreted as including only such oaths. Jesus surely did not intend to 
                        abolish now, in advance of the general abrogation of the law, those statutes of 
                        Moses which allowed, and in some instances required, the administration of an 
                        oath. See 
                        <span class="style7">Exodus 22: 11; Numbers 5: 19</span>. What we style the judicial oaths of the law of Moses then were not included in the prohibition. This conclusion is also reached when we interpret the prohibition in the light of authoritative examples; for we find that God swore by himself (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 22: 16, 17; Hebrews 6: 13; 7: 21</span></span>). Jesus answered under oath before the Sanhedrin (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 26: 63,</span></span>), and Paul also made oath to the Corinthian church (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Corinthians 1: 23</span></span>). See also 
                        <span class="style7">Romans 1: 9; Galatians 1: 20; Philippians 1: 8; 1 Corinthians 15: 31; Revelation 10: 5, 6</span>. 

                        We conclude, then, that judicial 
                        oaths, and oaths taken in the name of God on occasions of solemn religious 
                        importance, are not included in the prohibition. But as these are the only 
                        exceptions found in Scriptures, we conclude that all other oaths are forbidden. 
                        Looking at the details of the paragraph, we find that oaths by heaven and by 
                        the earth, by Jerusalem and by the head, are utterly meaningless save as they 
                        have reference to God. "Swearing is a sin whereunto neither profit 
                        incites, nor pleasure allures, nor necessity compels, nor inclination of nature 
                        persuades"--Quarles.</span>)



                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> Ye have heard that it was said (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 21: 24; Leviticus 24: 20; Deuteronomy 19: 21</span></span>), An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 


                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil (<span class="comm">The lex talionis, or law of like for like, was the best possible rule in a rude state of society, its object being not to sacrifice the second eye, but to save both, by causing a man when in a passion to realize that every injury which he inflicted upon his adversary he would in the end inflict upon himself. From this rule the scribes drew the false inference that revenge was proper, and that a man was entitled to exercise it. Thus a law intended to prevent revenge was so perverted that it was used as a warrant for it. This command which enjoins non-resistance, like most of the other precepts of this sermon, does not demand of us absolute, unqualified pacivity at all times and under all circumstances. In fact, we may say generally of the whole sermon on the mount that it is not a code for slaves, but an assertion of principles which are to be interpreted and applied by the children of freedom. We are to submit to evil for principle's sake and to accomplish spiritual victories, and not in an abject, servile spirit as blind followers of a harsh and exacting law. On the contrary, taking the principle, we judge when and how to apply it as best we can. Absolute non-resistance may so far encourage crime as to become a sin. As in the case of the precept about swearing just above, Jesus distributes the universal prohibition by the specification of certain examples, which in this case are three in number</span>): but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. (<span class="comm">This first example is taken from the realm of physical violence. The example given, a slap in the face, has been regarded as a gross insult in all ages, but it is not an assault which imperils life. We find this precept illustrated by the conduct of the Master himself. He did not literally turn the other cheek to be smitten, but he breathed forth a mild and gentle reproof where he might have avenged himself by the sudden death of his adversary (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 18: 22, 23</span></span>). The example of Paul also is given, but it is not so perfect as that of the Master (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 23: 2-5</span></span>). Self-preservation is a law of God giving rights which, under most circumstances, a Christian can claim. He may resist the robber, the assassin and all men of that ilk, and may protect his person and his possessions against the assaults of the violent and lawless (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 16: 35-39</span></span>). But when the honor of 
                        Christ and the salvation of man demands it, he should observe this commandment 
                        even unto the very letter.</span>)



                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. (<span class="comm">This second case is one of judicial injustice, and teaches that the most annoying exactions are to be endured without revenge. The coat was the inner garment, and the cloak was the outer or more costly one. The creditor was not allowed to retain it over night, even when it was given to him as a pledge from the poor, because it was used for a bed-covering (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 22: 26, 27</span></span>). 
                        The idea therefore is, "Be ready to give up even that which by law can 
                        not be taken" (<span class="comm">Mansel</span>). This case, as the one just above, is also 
                        an instance of petty persecution, and shows that the command does not forbid a 
                        righteous appeal to the law in cases where large and important interests are 
                        involved.</span>)




                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile (<span class="comm">the Roman 
                        mile; it was 142 yards short of the English mile</span>), go with him 
                    two. (<span class="comm">This third instance is a case of governmental oppression. It supposes 
                        a man to be impressed by government officials to go a mile. The custom alluded 
                        to is said to have originated with Cyrus, king of Persia, and it 

                        empowered a government courier to impress both men and horses to help him 
                        forward. For an example of governmental impress, see 
                        <span class="style7">Luke 23: 26</span>. The exercise of this power by the Romans was 
                        exceedingly distasteful to Jews, and this circumstance gave a special 
                        pertinency to the Saviour's mention of it. (<span class="comm">See Herodotus 8: 98; Xen. Cyrop. 
                            8: 6, 7; Josephus' Antiquities 13: 2, 3.</span>) The command, "Go with him two," 
                        requires a cheerful compliance with the demands of a tyrannical 
                        government--a doubling of the hardship or duty required rather than a 
                        resistance to the demand. But here again the oppression is not an insupportable 
                        one. A man might go two miles and yet not lose his whole day's labor. The 
                        Saviour chooses these lesser evils because they bring out more distinctly the 
                        motives of conduct. If we resist the smaller evils of life, we thereby manifest 
                        a spirit of pride seeking revenge; but when the larger evils come upon us, they 
                        waken other motives. A man may strive for self-protection when life is 
                        threatened without any spirit of revenge. He may appeal to the law to protect 
                        his property without any bitterness toward the one who seeks to wrest it from 
                        him, and he may set himself against the oppression of his government from the 
                        loftiest motives of patriotism. If revenge slumbers in our breast, little 
                        injuries will waken it as quickly as big ones.</span>) 




                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> Give to him that asketh 
                    thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. (<span class="comm">Jesus 
                        here turns from the negative to the positive side of life. Our conduct, instead 
                        of being selfish and revengeful, should be generous and liberal. A benevolent 
                        disposition casts out revenge as light does darkness. No lending was provided 
                        for by the law of Moses except for benevolent purposes, for no interest was 
                        allowed, and all debts were canceled every seventh year. The giving and lending 
                        referred to, then, are limited to cases of real want, and the amount given or 
                        loaned is to be regulated accordingly. Giving or lending to the encouragement 
                        of vice or indolence can not, of course, be here included. Good actions are 
                        marred if they bear evil fruit.</span>)

                    and pray for them that persecute you;  that 
                    despitefully use you. (<span class="comm">The law commanding love will be found at 
                        <span class="style7">Leviticus 19: 18</span>, while the sentiment &quot;hate thy enemy&quot; is not found in the law as a precept. But the Jews were forbidden by law to make peace with the Canaanites (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 34: 11-16; Deuteronomy 7: 2; 23: 6</span></span>), and the bloody wars which were waged by God's own command inevitably taught them to hate them. This was the feeling of their most pious men (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Chronicles 20: 3; 2 Kings 13: 19</span></span>), and it found utterance even in their 
                        devotional hymns; e. g., 
                        <span class="style7">Psalm 137: 8, 9; 139: 21, 22</span>. It is a true representation of the law, therefore, in its practical working, that it taught hatred of one's enemies. This is one of the defects of the Jewish dispensation, which, like the privilege of divorce at will, was to endure but for a time. To love an enemy has appeared to many persons impossible, because they understand the word &quot;love&quot; as here expressing the same feeling in all respects which are entertained toward a friend or a near kinsman. But love has many shades and degrees. The exact phase of it which is here enjoined is best understood in the light of examples. The parable of the good Samaritan is given by Jesus for the express purpose of exemplifying it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 10: 35-37</span></span>); his own example in praying on the cross for those who crucified him serves the same purpose, as does also the prayer of Stephen made in imitation of it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 34; Acts 7: 60</span></span>). The feeling which enables us to deal with an enemy after the 
                        manner of the Samaritan, or Jesus, or Stephen, is the love for our enemies 
                        which is here enjoined. It is by no means an impossible feeling. Prayer, too, 
                        can always express it, for as Hooker says, "Prayer is that which we 
                        always have in our power to bestow, and they never in theirs to refuse."</span>)

                        does not make us sons of God, but it proves us such by showing our resemblance 
                        to him. We are made children of God by regeneration. God, in his daily conduct 
                        toward the children of this earth, does not carry his discrimination to any

                        their servants--the men who actually collected the taxes, and the official 
                        name for them was portitores. These latter were sometimes freedmen or 
                        slaves, and sometimes natives of the province in which the tax was collected.

                        made the tax itself odious, and hence the men through whom it was extorted from 
                        them were equally odious. These men were regarded in the double aspect of
