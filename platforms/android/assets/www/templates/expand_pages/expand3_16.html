        <h3>16. TEMPTED IN THE WILDERNESS.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 4: 1-11; MARK 1: 12-13; LUKE 4: 1-13.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4:1</span>  And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from 
            the Jordan,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4:12</span> And straightway the Spirit driveth him 
            forth  and 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4:1</span> Then (<span class="comm">Just 
                after his baptism, with the glow of the descended Spirit still upon him, and 
                the commending voice of the Father still ringing in his ears, Jesus is rushed 
                into the suffering of temptation. Thus abrupt and violent are the changes of 
                life. The spiritually exalted may expect these sharp contrasts. After being in 
                the third heaven, Paul had a messenger of Satan to buffet him--<span class="style7">2 Corinthians 12: 7</span></span>) was Jesus led up (<span class="comm">The two 
                expressions "driveth" and "led up" show that Jesus was 
                drawn to the wilderness by an irresistible impulse, and did not go hither of 
                his own volition (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ezekiel 40: 2</span></span>). He was 
                brought into temptation, but did not seek it. He was led of God into 
                temptation, but was not tempted of God. God 

                may bring us into 
                temptation (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 6: 13; 26: 41; Job 1: 12; 2: 6</span></span>), and may make temptation a blessing unto us, tempering it to our 
                strength, and making us stronger by the victory over it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 10: 13; James 1: 2, 12</span></span>), but God himself never tempts 
                us--<span class="style7">James 1: 13</span></span>) of the Spirit 
            into the wilderness (<span class="comm">The wilderness sets in back of Jericho and extends 
                thence along the whole western shore of the Dead Sea. The northern end of this 
                region is in full view from the Jordan as one looks westward, and a more 
                desolate and forbidding landscape it would be hard to find. It is vain to 
                locate the temptation in any particular part of it. Jesus may have wandered 
                about over nearly all of it</span>) to be tempted of the devil (<span class="comm">As a second 
                David, Jesus went forth to meet that Goliath who had so long vaunted himself 
                against all who sought to serve God, and had as yet found none to vanquish him. 
                The account of the temptation must have been given to the disciples by Jesus 
                himself, and as it pleased him to give it to us as an actual history of real 
                facts, it behooves us to accept it without being presumptuously inquisitive. Of 
                course, it has supernatural features, but the supernatural confronts us all 
                through the life of Jesus, so there is nothing strange about it here. Jesus had 
                taken upon him our flesh, and hence he could be tempted, with a possibility of 
                falling. But his divinity insured his victory over temptation. He became like 
                us in ability to fall, that he might make us like unto himself in power to 
                resist. It behooved him to be tempted, and thus sharing our nature with its 
                weakness and temptation he might bring us to share his nature with its strength 
                and sinlessness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 2: 17-18; 4: 15-
                        16</span></span>). Sinlessness does not preclude temptation, else Adam could not 
                have been tempted, nor could Satan himself have fallen. Moreover, temptation is 
                in so sense sin. It is the yielding of the will to temptation which constitutes 
                sin. The spiritual history of humanity revolves around two persons; namely, the 
                first and the second Adam. The temptation of Christ was as real as that of 
                Adam. He had taken upon himself our temptable nature (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Philippians 2: 7-8</span></span>), and he was tempted not as a private soldier, 
                but as the second Adam, the Captain of 

                our salvation (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 2: 10-18</span></span>). The failure of the 
                first Adam brought sorrow, darkness and death; the success of the second Adam 
                brought joy, light and immortality. One of the tenets of modern infidelity is 
                the denial of the personality of the devil. It is asserted that the idea of a 
                devil was not known to the early Hebrews, but was borrow from Persian dualism. 
                The Persians held that there were two contending deities--a good one and a 
                bad one; and the Hebrews, according to these critics, learned this doctrine 
                from the Persians during the days of their Babylonian captivity, and modified 
                it so that the god of evil became the devil. But such a theory is based upon 
                the absurd notion that all the books of the Old Testament were written after 
                the return of the Jews from Babylon. Their theory requires this notion, for the 
                books of Genesis and Job, which were written centuries before the captivity, 
                both show a knowledge of this being, and the first connects him and his work 
                with the very beginning of human history. Those who believe in the inspiration 
                of the Scriptures must also believe in the personality of the devil, for they 
                plainly teach it. The devil is a fallen angel (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jude 6; 2 Peter 2: 4</span></span>). This doctrine need startle no one, for as 
                there are good and bad spirits in the body, so there are good and bad spirits 
                out of the body. Since God permits sinful spirits in the body, why should he 
                not also permit them out of the body? If there can be a Herod, a Nero, a Judas, 
                among men, why may there not be a Satan among evil spirits? Being but an angel, 
                Satan is neither omnipresent, omniscient nor omnipotent. He is only a tolerated 
                rebel, as we are tolerated rebels. He was the first sinner (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 3: 8</span></span>), and was the originator of sin
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 8: 44</span></span>). He is the perpetual 
                tempter of mankind (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 20: 2-8</span></span>), but 
                he shall be conquered by the Redeemer (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 12: 
                        31; Revelation 12: 9</span></span>), and may be conquered by us also through the grace 
                of Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Peter 5: 8-9; James 4: 7</span></span>); 
                but is, nevertheless, dangerous (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 2: 10; 3: 
                        9</span> </span>). Jesus, therefore, teaches us to pray for deliverance from him 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matt. 6: 13, R.V.</span></span>). Jesus will destroy 
                the works of Satan (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 3: 8</span></span>), and 
                Satan himself shall suffer eternal punishment 

                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 20: 10</span></span>). There is but one devil in the 
                spirit world. The word which our King James Version translates 
                "devils" should be translated "demons." The word 
                "devil" means false accuser or slanderer, and the word in the 
                plural is twice applied, metaphorically, to men and women (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Timothy 3: 3; 1 Timothy 3: 11</span></span>). The devil is 
                called slanderer because he speaks against men (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 12: 10-12</span></span>) and against God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 3: 1-5</span></span>). The word "devil" is Greek. The 
                word "Satan" is Hebrew, and means adversary (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Job 2: 1</span></span>). Satan is referred to under many other terms, such 
                as Beelzebub (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 12: 24</span></span>); serpent <span class="style7">Rev. 12: 9</span></span>); prince of the powers of 
            the air (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 2: 2</span></span>); Abaddon (<span class="comm">Hebrew</span>) 
            and Apollyon (<span class="comm">Greek</span>), meaning destroyer (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 9: 
                    11</span></span>); Belial, meaning good for nothing (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Corinthians 6: 15</span></span>); murderer and liar (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 8: 44</span></span>); prince of this world 
            (<span class="comm"><span class="style7"> John 12: 31</span></span>); god of this world (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Corinthians 4: 4</span></span>); and the dragon (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 12: 
                    7</span></span>). These terms are always used in the Bible to designate an actual 
            person; they are never used merely to personify evil. The devil may have 
            appeared to Jesus in bodily form, or he may have come insensibly as he does to 
            us. Our Lord's temptation makes the personality of the tempter essential, else 
            Christ's own heart must have suggested evil to him, which is incompatible with 
            his perfect holiness.</span>) 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1:13</span> And he was  led in the Spirit (<span class="comm">that is, under the power of the Spirit</span>) 
            in the wilderness (<span class="comm">Isolation from humanity is no security from temptation. 
                In fact, our present passage of Scripture shows that it is highly favorable to 
                temptation. The experience of all hermits shows that loneliness is the mother 
                of a multitude of evil desires</span>) 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4:2</span> during forty days (<span class="comm">Matthew speaks of 
                the temptation as coming "after" forty days. Evidently Mark and 
                Luke regard the long fast as part of the process of temptation, seeing that 
                without it the first temptation would have been without force. There is no 
                evidence of any other specific temptations before the three</span>), being 
            tempted of  Satan;  the 
            devil,  and he was with the wild beasts (<span class="comm">A graphic 
                touch, showing the dreariness and desolation of the wilderness, and indicating 
                its peril. Lions, 

                wolves, leopards and serpents have been found in 
                the Jud&aelig;an wilderness</span>);  And he did eat 
            nothing (<span class="comm">It used to be thought that a forty days' absolute fast was a 
                practical impossibility, and Luke's words were therefore modified to mean that 
                he ate very little. But as a forty days' fast has been safely accomplished in 
                modern times, and as it was Jesus who fasted, we see no reason why we should 
                not take Luke's statement literally, as indicating an absolute fast</span>) in 
            those days: and when they were completed.  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4:2</span> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights (<span class="comm">A forty days' fast 
                was accomplished by Moses (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 34: 28; Deuteronomy 
                        9: 18</span></span>), and by Elijah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 19: 
                        8</span></span>), and it is a significant fact in this connection that these two 
                men appeared with Christ at his transfiguration (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 17: 3</span></span>). Those who share Christ's sufferings shall also share 
                his glorification (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 8: 17; 2 Timothy 2: 11-
                        12</span></span>). The forty days' fast became a basis for the temptation. We are 
                told that temptation results from the excitement of desire (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 1: 14</span></span>), and, as a rule, the greater the 
                desire the greater the temptation. Viewed from this standpoint the temptation 
                of the second Adam greatly exceeded in strength that of the first, for Adam 
                abstained as to a particular fruit, but Christ fasted as to all things 
                edible</span>), he afterward hungered. (<span class="comm">Here, for the first time, our 
                Lord is shown as sharing our physical needs. We should note for our comfort 
                that one may lack bread and suffer want, and still be infinitely beloved in 
                heaven.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4:3</span> And the tempter came (<span class="comm">Satan is pre-eminently the tempter, for 
                other tempters are his agents. He may possibly have appeared as an angel of 
                light (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Cor. 11: 14</span></span>), but the 
                purpose of his coming is more important than the manner of it. He came to 
                produce sin in Jesus, for sin would render him forever incapable of becoming 
                our Saviour--a sacrifice for the sins of others</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4:3</span> And the devil said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command this 
            stone that it {command that these stones} become 
            bread. (<span class="comm">The devil's "if" strikes at the faith of Christ, and 
                faith is the bond of union and accord between man and God. The main sin of this 
                temptation was therefore distrust, though 

                it had other sinful 
                phases. The Father's voice had just declared the Sonship of Jesus, and Satan 
                here boldly questions the truth of God's words, just as he did in the beginning 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 3: 3-5</span></span>). The temptation 
                smacks of curiosity, and curiosity is the mother of many sins. Though Satan so 
                glibly questioned the divinity of Christ, his kingdom soon began to feel the 
                power of that divinity (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 4: 
                        34-41</span></span>), and shall continue to feel it until his kingdom is 
                destroyed (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 2: 14; 1 John 3: 8</span></span>). This temptation appealed to the present appetite, the impulse of the moment, 
                as many of our temptations do. It has been quaintly said of the tempter that 
                "he had sped so successfully to his own mind by a temptation about a 
                matter of eating with the first Adam, that he practiced the old manner of 
                trading with the second." This first temptation is still Satan's favorite 
                with the poor. He suggests to them that if they were really the beloved objects 
                of God's care, their condition would be otherwise. We should note that Jesus 
                wrought no selfish miracle. Such an act would have been contrary to all 
                Scripture precedent. Paul did not heal himself (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 12: 7-9; Galatians 4: 13; Colossians 4: 14</span></span>), nor Epaphroditus, 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Philippians 2: 25-27</span></span>), nor 
                Trophimus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Timothy 4: 20</span></span>). Denying 
                himself the right to make bread in the wilderness, Christ freely used his 
                miraculous power to feed others in the desert (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 14: 15-21</span></span>), and merited as just praise those words 
                which were meant as a bitter taunt--<span class="style7">Matthew 27: 42.</span>)</span> 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4:4</span> But he (<span class="comm"><span class="style5">Luke 4:4</span> And Jesus</span>) answered and said,  unto him, It 
            is written (<span class="comm">Jesus quotes<span class="style7"> Deuteronomy 8: 3</span></span>). It is a saying relative to the times when Israel was sustained by manna in 
            the wilderness. The case of Jesus was now similar to that of Israel. He was in 
            a foodless wilderness, but he trusted that as God had provided for Israel in 
            its helplessness, so would he now provide for him. Israel sinned by doubt and 
            murmuring, and proposing to obtain bread in its own way--that is, by 
            returning to Egypt (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 16: 1-9</span></span>). Jesus avoided a like sin. We should note the use which our Lord made of 
            Scripture: in his hour of trial he did not look to visions and voices and 
            special revelation for guidance, but used the written Word as the lamp 

            for his feet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 119: 105</span></span>); 
            in the conflict of temptation he did not defend himself by his own divine 
            wisdom, but used that wisdom which God had revealed to all Israel through his 
            prophets. Jesus fought as a man (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Philippians 2: 6-
                    7</span></span>), and used that weapon which, as God, he had given to man 
            (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 6: 17</span></span>). Jesus used the Scripture 
            as of final, argument-ending authority. Eve also started with "God hath 
            said" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Gen. 3: 3</span></span>); but she was 
            not constant in her adherence to God's word. Jesus permitted Satan neither to 
            question nor pervert the Scripture</span>), Man (<span class="comm">In using the word 
                "man" Jesus takes his stand with us as a human being</span>) shall not 
            live by bread alone (<span class="comm">Called out of Egypt as God's Son (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 2: 15</span></span>), Jesus could well expect that he 
                would be fed with manna after his forty days' fast. He trusted that God could 
                furnish a table in the wilderness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 78: 
                        19</span></span>). We, too, have abundant reason for a like trust. God gave us our 
                lives, and gave his Son to redeem them from sin. He may let us suffer, but we 
                can not perish is we trust him. Let us live by his word rather than by bread. 
                It is better to die for righteousness than to live by sin. God fed Israel with 
                supernatural bread, to show the people that they lived thus, and not by what 
                they were pleased to call natural means. The stomach is a useful agent, but it 
                is not the source of life, nor even the life sustainer. Those who think that 
                the securing of bread is the first essential to the sustaining of life, will 
                fail to seek any diviner food, and so will eventually starve with 
                hunger--soul hunger.</span>)   but by every word that 
            proceedeth out of the mouth of God (<span class="comm">To satisfy our sense of duty is often

                trust of Jesus that God would speak in his behalf and save him, was like that 
                of Job (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Job 13: 15</span></span>). God can sustain 
                our lives without food if he chooses. We shall live if God wills it, bread or 
                no bread; and we shall likewise die at his word (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matt. 6: 25; John 6: 47-58; Acts 17: 28</span></span>). God can support 
                our lives independent of our body--<span class="style7">Matthew 10:

                compulsory companionship of Satan. Jesus was in the hands of Satan as 
                was Job (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Job 2: 5-6</span></span>); but in Jesus' 
                case Satan had the power of life and death, and he eventually took Jesus to the 
                cross and slew him there</span>) into the holy city (<span class="comm">A common name for 
                Jerusalem. The inscription on Jewish coins was "Jerusalem the 
                Holy." Arabs to-day call it "el Kuds," "the 
                Holy." The Holy City did not exclude the tempter nor temptations. The 
                church may be the scene of man's sorest trial to resist wrong. But in the Holy 
                City which is to come there will be no temptation</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4:9</span> And he led him to Jerusalem,  and set 
            him (<span class="comm">The two verbs "taketh" and "setting" imply 
                that Satan exercised a control over the bodily person of our Lord</span>) on the 
            pinnacle of the temple (<span class="comm">It is not known exactly what spot is indicated by 
                the word "pinnacle." Hence three places have been contended for the 
                proper locality: 1. The apex of the temple structure itself. 2. The top of 
                Solomon's porch. 3. The top of Herod's royal portico. As to the temple itself, 
                Josephus tells us that its roof was covered with spikes of gold, to prevent 
                even birds from alighting upon it, and, if so, men could not stand upon it. 
                Solomon's porch, or the eastern portico, faced the Mount of Olives, and has 
                been fixed upon by tradition as the place from which James, the Lord's brother, 
                was hurled. The royal portico of Herod was at the southeast corner of the 
                temple enclosure, and overlooked the valley of Kidron. Here was then, and is 
                yet, the greatest height about the temple, and it was, therefore, the most 
                suitable place for Satan's proposal</span>),

                faith. The life the devil would have us lead rests on ifs and uncertainties, on 
                doubt and skepticism. We should note that foolish men doubt the divinity of 
                Jesus, but the temptations of our Lord show how positively Satan was convinced 
                of it. The opening scenes of Christ's ministry are redolent with his divinity. 
                The Baptist asserted his purity and might, the Spirit visibly acknowledged his 
                worthiness, the Father audibly testified to his Sonship, and the devil twice 
                assaulted him as the divine champion</span>) thou art the Son of God, cast thyself 
            down 

            (<span class="comm">The first temptation was to under-confidence; the second 
                to over-trust and presumption--two very dangerous conditions of the soul. 
                Men begin by disparagingly doubting that Jesus can save them from their sins, 
                and end by recklessly presuming that he will save them in their sins. Comparing 
                this with Eve's temptation, we find that she was vainly curious to see if she 
                might be like God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 3: 5</span></span>), but 
                Christ resisted such curiously. It is urged by some as to this temptation that 
                there is no hint of vainglory or display, because nothing is said about casting 
                himself down in the presence of the people, and that Jesus was merely taken to 
                the temple because the sacred locality would tend to heighten his trust in the 
                protecting promise which Satan quoted. But this ground is not well taken, for 
                1. The temple presumes a crowd. 2. We have a right to presume that this 
                temptation would be like others to which Jesus was subjected. He was frequently 
                invited to work miracles to satisfy curiosity, and he invariably refused to do 
                so</span>):  from hence:

                full of Scripture, but to no profit, for his heart is empty of it. 2. By 
                quoting it he shows a sense of its power which modern rationalism would do well 
                to consider. 3. Satan's abuse of Scripture did not discourage Christ's use of 
                it</span>), He shall give his angels charge concerning thee (<span class="comm">Regarding 
                Satan's words as a quotation, we are struck with the fact that his knowledge of 
                this particular passage was based upon his personal experience. He had been 
                confronted by the presence of the guardian angels and had fretted at it 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Job 1: 10; 2 Kings 6: 8, 17; Psalm 34: 7; 
                        Jude 9</span></span>). As a temptation, Satan's words appeal to Jesus to be more 
                religious; to put more trust and reliance upon the promises of the Father; and 
                he puts him in the place--the temple--where he might argue that God 
                could least afford to let his promise fail</span>), to guard thee:

                have no higher indorsement of the Old Testament than this use of it by Christ. 
                It was sufficient for him in his temptations, and with the addition of the New 
                Testament, it is sufficient for us in all things--<span class="style7">2 Timothy 3: 16-17; Col. 3: 3-16</span></span>),Thou shalt not make trial (<span class="comm">Make experiment upon God, set

                have demanded of the Father a needless miracle to prove his Sonship, and would 
                thereby have put the love of God to an unnecessary trial. All who jeopardize

                mountain-top, but that Satan showed them to him. From any high 
                Jud&aelig;an mountain it would be easy for him to locate Rome, Greece, Egypt, 
                Persia and Assyria, and as he pointed out their locality a few brief words of 
                description would picture them to the imagination of Jesus, and cause their 
                glories to move before his eyes. But it is very likely that to this description 
                some sort of supernatural vision was added. It tempted the eye of Jesus as the 
                luscious fruit did the eye of Eve--<span class="style7">Genesis 3: 
                    6</span></span>) all the kingdoms of the world (<span class="comm">It tempted Jesus to realize 
                the dreams 

                which the Jewish nation entertained. It was an appeal to 
                him to reveal himself in the fullness of his power and authority as above 
                generals, princes, kings, and all beings of all ages. An appeal to obtain by 
                physical rather than by spiritual power; by the short-cut path of policy rather 
                than by the long road of suffering and martyrdom. Jesus came to obtain the 
                kingdoms of the world. He was born King of the Jews, and confessed himself to 
                be a King before Pilate. All authority is now given to him, and he must reign 
                until he puts all his enemies under his feet, and until all the kingdoms of the 
                world become his kingdom. Satan's way to obtain this kingdom differed from 
                God's way. He might obtain it by doing Satan's will and becoming his worshiper, 
                or by worshiping God and doing his will. Satan would give the speedier 
                possession, but God the more lasting. We also strive for a kingdom; but let us 
                obtain ours as Christ did his</span>), and the glory of them (<span class="comm">That is, 
                all their resources as well as their magnificence. Their cities, lands and 
                people, their armies, treasures and temples, etc. Many parents, in encouraging 
                their children to seek earthly glory and distinction, unconsciously assist 
                Satan in urging this temptation</span>);  in a moment of 
            time (<span class="comm">These words strongly indicate that the prospect must have been 
                supernaturally presented. The suddenness of the vision added greatly to the 
                power of the temptation</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4:9</span> and he
            (<span class="comm">the devil</span>) said unto him, To thee will I give all this 
            authority {All these things will I give thee,} 
            (<span class="comm">From the standpoint of Christ's humanity, how overwhelming the temptation! It 
                was the world's honors to one who had for thirty years led the life of a 
                village carpenter; it was the world's riches to him who had not where to lay 
                his head. From the standpoint of Jesus' divinity the temptation was repulsive. 
                It was a large offer in the sight of Satan, but a small one in the sight of him 
                who made all the worlds. Such offers are large to the children of the world, 
                but small to those who are by faith joint-heirs with Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 8: 17; Philippians 3: 7-8</span></span>). But the 
                temptation was, nevertheless, very specious and plausible. The power of Jesus 
                linked with that of Satan, and 

                operating through Jewish fanaticism 
                and pagan expectation would, in a few months, have brought the whole earth into 
                one temporal kingdom, with Jesus as its head. But the kingdom of Christ rested 
                upon a surer promise (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 2: 8</span></span>) than 
                that here given by the "father of lies." God had promised, and, 
                despite the pretensions of Satan, God had not yet retired from the government 
                of the world. It was true that Satan and his emissaries had, by usurpation, 
                gained an apparent possession of the world, but Jesus had right to it as the 
                heir of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 21: 33-43</span></span>). Being stronger than Satan, he had come to regain his kingdom, not by treaty, 
                but by conquest (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 11: 19-22</span></span>). Moreover, he would obtain it as a spiritual and not as a carnal kingdom. 
                Servants of Christ should remember this. Every attempt to establish Messiah's 
                kingdom as an outward, worldly dominion is an effort to convert the kingdom of 
                heaven into the kingdom of the devil. God's kingdom can not be secularized. It 
                should be noted also that Satan omits the words "if thou art the Son of 
                God" in this instance, for their presence would have marred the force of 
                the temptation. Note also that this was the only temptation wherein Satan 
                evinced any show of generosity. He is slow to give anything, and most of us 
                sell out to him for nothing--<span class="style7">Isaiah 52: 
                    3</span></span>), and the glory of them: for it hath been delivered unto 
            me (<span class="comm">Satan does not claim an absolute but a derivative right, and his claim 
                is not wholly unfounded (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 12: 31; 14: 30; 
                        16: 11</span></span>). But the kingdom has been delivered unto him by men rather 
                than by God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 2: 2</span></span>). How much more 
                quickly Jesus would have obtained power, had he received it from men by 
                consenting to co-operate with them in their sinful practices as does Satan</span>)
            ; and to whomsoever I will (<span class="comm">Not so Jesus. His giving is according to 
                the Father's will--<span class="style7">Matthew 9: 23</span></span>) 
            I give it (<span class="comm">The Emperor Tiberius then held it in the fullest sense ambition 
                ever realized. Yet he was the most miserable and degraded of men. Satan knows

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4:7</span> If (<span class="comm">In the temptations 
                Satan uses three "ifs." The first "if" is one of 
                despairing doubt; the second, one of vainglorious speculation; the third, one 
                of moral and 

                spiritual compromise</span>) thou therefore wilt
            fall down and worship  before me 
            (<span class="comm">Satan and God each seek the worship of man, but from very different motives. 
                God is holiness and goodness, and we are invited to worship him that we may 
                thereby be induced to grow like him. But Satan seeks worship for vanity's sake. 
                How vast the vanity which would give so great a reward for one act of worship! 
                Verily the devil is fond of it. He gives nothing unless he obtains it, and all 
                his generosity is selfishness. Worshiping before Satan is the bending of the 
                soul rather than of the body. He holds before each of us some crown of success, 
                and says: "Bend just a little; slightly compromise your conscience. 
                Accept the help of Pharisee and Sadducee, and keep silent as to their sins. Mix 
                a little diplomacy with your righteousness. Stoop just a little. If you do, I 
                will aid you and insure your success. If you do not, I will defeat you and 
                laugh at your failures." It is Satan's sin to make such suggestions, but 
                it is not our sin until we comply with them. We may more quickly obtain by his 
                wrong way, but more surely by God's right way. Let no Christian be humiliated 
                or discouraged by gross temptation, since even the Son of God was tempted to 
                worship the devil. What Jesus would not do, the Beast has done, and has 
                received the kingdoms for a season (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Revelation 13: 
                        1-9</span></span>). Note, too, that it is all one whether we worship Satan, 
                or mammon, the gift which he offers--<span class="style7">Matthew 6: 
                    24</span></span>), it shall all be thine.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4:10, Luke 4:8 
            </span> Then  Jesus answered

            him,  Get thee hence (<span class="comm">The passionate utterance of 
                an aroused soul. Indignation is as divine as patience (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 4: 26</span></span>). Satan's sweetest temptation was most disgusting 
                to Christ, for its sin was so grossly apparent. It ran counter to the very 
                first of the ten commandments. Jesus would give it no room in his thoughts; he 
                spurned it, as being as heinous as the law describes it (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 5: 6-11</span></span>). Temptation must be peremptorily 
                rejected. Jesus did not stop to weigh the worthiness of Satan; it was 
                sufficient that God only is to be worshiped. As God, Jesus was himself an 
                object of worship; but as man he worshiped the Father privately and publicly. 
                Satan 

                sought to command Jesus, but was commanded of him. Step by 
                step Satan has obeyed this command, and foot after foot, earth's spiritual 
                world has been yielded by his departing presence</span>), Satan (<span class="comm">The 
                first and second temptations were so subtle and covert, and their sin so 
                skillfully disguised, as to suggest that Satan himself was disguised. If so, 
                his pride and vanity, revealed in this last temptation, betrayed him so that 
                Jesus tore off his mask and called him by his right name. When he tempted him 
                in a somewhat similar matter, Jesus called Simon Peter by this name (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 16: 23</span></span>), but he laid a different command 
                upon each of them. To Satan he spoke as an enemy, saying, "Get thee 
                hence." He ordered Satan from his presence, for he had no proper place 
                there. To Peter he spoke as to a presumptuous disciple, saying, "Get thee 
                behind me." The disciple is a follower of his master, and his proper 
                place is in the rear</span>): for it is written (<span class="comm">Jesus gives a free 
                translation of <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 6: 13</span>. He 
                substitutes the word "worship" for the word "fears." 
                Fear prohibits false and induces true worship, and loving worship is the source 
                of all acceptable service. The three Scripture quotations used by Jesus are all 
                from the book of Deuteronomy. He struck Satan with that very part of the 
                Spirit's sword which modern critical infidelity, in the name of religion, and 
                often aided by so-called religious organizations, seeks to persuade us to cast 
                away</span>), Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou 
            serve. (<span class="comm">By serving God, Jesus obtained all the earthly authority which the 
                devil offered him, and heavenly authority in addition thereto (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 28: 18</span></span>). So much better are the rewards 
                of God than Satan's.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4:13</span> And when the devil had 
            completed every temptation.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4:11</span> Then the 
            devil leaveth {he departeth from} him for a 
            season. (<span class="comm">See <span class="style7">James 4: 7</span></span>). But Satan 
            left to return many times. Here was the first being endowed with human nature 
            who had defeated Satan under all circumstances for thirty years. This was 
            Satan's first defeat under Christ's ministry. His last is yet to come, and it 
            shall come by this same Christ. Temptations are battles. They leave the victor 
            stronger and the 

            vanquished weaker. Hence Satan when resisted is 
            represented as fleeing. But he only flees for a season. He never despairs of 
            the conflict so long as man is on the earth. Christ was constantly tempted by 
            the returning devil (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 22: 28</span></span>). As 
            Jesus hung upon the cross, all these three temptations with their accompanying 
            "ifs" were spread out before him--<span class="style7">Matthew 27: 39-43</span></span>)   and 
            behold, angels came (<span class="comm">They had probably witnessed the contest. Compare <span class="style7">1 Corinthians 4: 9; 1 Timothy 3: 16</span>. Angels 
                do not appear again visibly ministering unto Jesus until we find him in 
                Gethsemane (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 22: 43</span></span>). When Satan 
                finally departs from us, we, too, shall find ourselves in the presence of 
                angels--<span class="style7">Luke 16: 22</span></span>) and 
            ministered unto him. (<span class="comm">Jesus was probably fed by the angels, as was Elijah 
                by one of them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Kings 19: 
                        4-7</span></span>). Satan and suffering first, then angels, refreshment and 
                rest. God had indeed given his angels charge, and they came to him who refused 
                to put the father to the test. But they did not succor Jesus during his 
                temptation, for that was to be resisted by himself alone--<span class="style7">Isaiah 63: 3</span>.</span>)
