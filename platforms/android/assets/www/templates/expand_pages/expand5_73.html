        <h3>73. HEROD ANTIPAS.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 14:1-12; MARK 6:14-29; LUKE 9: 7-9.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 14</span>  And  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 7</span>  Now


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 14: 1</span>  At that season  King Herod 
            (<span class="comm">Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great. See page 63.</span>)   the 
            tetrarch heard of all that was done  heard the report 
            concerning Jesus,  for his name had become known:
            and he was perplexed, because that it was said by some, that 
            John was risen from the dead; 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 8</span> and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. (<span class="comm">The work of Jesus impressed the people as prophetic rather than Messianic, for they associated the Messiah in their thoughts with an earthly kingdom of great pomp and grandeur. Jesus, therefore, did not appear to them to be the Messiah, but rather the prophet who should usher in the Messiah. Their Scriptures taught them that Elijah would be that prophet. But the Apocrypha indicated that it might be Isaiah or Jeremiah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Maccabees 14: 41</span></span>). Hence the 
                many opinions as to which of the prophets Jesus was. If he was Elijah, he could 
                not be properly spoken of as risen from the dead, for Elijah had been 
                translated.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And Herod said, unto his servants, John I beheaded (<span class="comm">For the imprisonment of John, see pages 138, 139. The mission of the twelve probably lasted several weeks, and the beheading of John the Baptist appears to have taken place about the time of their return. See page 374</span>): but who is this, about whom I hear such things? This is John the Baptist; { the Baptizer} he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him. (<span class="comm">John had wrought no miracle while living (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10: 41</span></span>), but there was a prevalent idea among the ancients that departed spirits were endowed with superhuman powers, and Herod therefore supposed that the risen John had brought these powers with him from the spirit world.</span>) And he sought to see him. (<span class="comm">Jesus purposely kept out of the reach of Herod, knowing the treacherous cunning of his nature (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 13: 32</span></span>), and Herod's curiosity was not gratified until the day of Christ's crucifixion (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 23: 8-12</span></span>), and then its gratification was without sanctification.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 15</span>  But others said, It is Elijah. And others 
            said, It is a prophet,
            even as one of the prophets.
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span>  But Herod, when he heard thereof,
            said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen. (<span class="comm">Some thought that 
                Elijah might have returned, as the Scripture declared, or that Jesus might be a 
                prophet just like the great prophets of old. Matthew, by introducing what 
                follows with the word "for," gives us the reason why Herod clung to 
                this singular opinion of Jesus. He did so because this opinion was begotten in 
                the morbid musings of a conscience stained with the blood of John.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span>  For 
            Herod himself had sent forth 

            and laid hold upon John,
            and bound him, and put him in prison the sake of Herodias, 
            his brother Philip's wife.  for he had married her. 
            (<span class="comm">Herodias was the daughter of Aristobulus, who was the half-brother of Herod 
                Philip 1: and Herod Antipas, and these two last were in turn half-brothers to 
                each other. Herodias, therefore, had married her uncle Herod Philip I, who was 
                disinherited by Herod the Great, and who lived as a private citizen in Rome. 
                When Herod Antipas went to Rome about the affairs of his tetrarchy, he became 
                the guest of his brother Herod Philip I., and repaid the hospitality which he 
                received by carrying off the wife of his host.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span>  For John said unto Herod, 
            It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. (<span class="comm">The marriage was 
                unlawful of three reasons: 1. The husband of Herodias was still living; 2. The 
                lawful wife of Antipas (<span class="comm">the daughter of Aretas, king or emir of Arabia</span>) was 
                still living; 3. Antipas and Herodias, being nephew and niece, were related to 
                each other within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity.</span>) 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span>  And Herodias 
            set herself against him, and desired to kill him; but she could not: 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span>  for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and 
            kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed, and he heard him 
            gladly.  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 14: 5</span> And when he would have put him 
            to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
            (<span class="comm">Herod feared both John and his influence. His fear of the man as a prophet 
                caused him to shelter John against any attempts which his angry wife might make 
                to put him to death, and led him to listen to John with enough respect to 
                become perplexed as to whether it were better to continue in his course or 
                repent. At other times, when the influence of Herodias moved him most strongly, 
                and he forgot his personal fear of John, he was yet restrained by fear of 
                John's influence over the people.</span>) 6 But when Herod's birthday came,


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 21</span>  And when a convenient day was come (<span class="comm">A 
                day suited to the purposes of Herodias. The phrase refers to 
                <span class="style7">Mark 6: 19</span></span>), that Herod on his birthday 
            made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and

            the chief men of Galilee; 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span>  and when the daughter of Herodias 
            herself (<span class="comm">the language seems to indicate that others had first come in and 
                danced</span>) came in and danced,  in the midst,
            she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him 
            (<span class="comm">This dancer was Salome, daughter of Herod Philip and niece of Herod Antipas. 
                The dancing of the East was then, as now, voluptuous and indecent, and nothing 
                but utter shamelessness or inveterate malice could have induced a princess to 
                thus make a public show of herself at such a carousal</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 14: 7</span>  Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she 
            should ask.  and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of 
            me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 23</span>  And he sware 
            unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half 
            of my kingdom. (<span class="comm">The rashness of the king's promise is characteristic of the 
                folly of sin. Riches, honors, kingdoms, souls are given for a bauble in the 
                devil's market.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span>  And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I 
            ask? (<span class="comm">She may have known beforehand what to ask. If so, she retired and 
                asked her mother that the brunt of the king's displeasure might fall upon her 
                mother.</span>) And she said, The head of John the Baptist.  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mathew 14: 8</span>  And she, being put forward by her mother,
            came in straightway with haste unto the king (<span class="comm">she wished 
                to make her request known before the king had time to put limitations upon her 
                asking</span>), and asked, saying, {saith}
            I will that thou forthwith give me  
            here on a platter the head of John the Baptist. (<span class="comm">She asked for the 
                prophet's head that she and her mother might have the witness of their own eyes 
                to the fact that he was dead, and that they might not be deceived about it.</span>) 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And the king was grieved;  was exceeding sorry 
            (<span class="comm">because the deed went against his conscience and his sense of policy as above 
                stated</span>); but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that {which} sat at meat,  he would not reject 
            her.  he commanded it to be given (<span class="comm">The oath alone 
                would not have constrained Herod to grant Salome's request, for if left alone 


                he would rightly have construed the request as not coming within 
                the scope of the oath. The terms of his oath looked to and anticipated a 
                pecuniary present, and not the commission of a crime. But Herod's companions, 
                being evil men, joined with the evil women against the man of God, and shamed 
                Herod into an act which committed him forever to a course of guilt. Thus, a bad 
                man's impulses are constantly broken down by his evil companions</span>); 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 6: 27</span>  And straightway the king forth a soldier of his 
            guard,  and beheaded John in the prison.and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in 
            the prison, 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span>  and brought his head {his head was brought}  on a platter, and 
            gave it {and given}  to the 
            damsel: and the damsel  brought it  
            gave it to her mother. (<span class="comm">To the anxious, unrestful soul of Herodias 
                this seemed a great gift, since it assured her that the voice of her most 
                dangerous enemy was now silent. But as Herod was soon filled with superstitious 
                fears that John had risen in the person of Christ, her sense of security was 
                very short-lived. The crime stamped Herod and Herodias with greater infamy than 
                that for which John had rebuked them.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span>  And when his disciples heard
            thereof, they came and took up his 
            {the} corpse,  and laid it in 
            a tomb.  and buried him; and went and told Jesus. 
            (<span class="comm">Herod had feared that the death of John would bring about a popular uprising, 
                and his fears were not mistaken. As soon as they had decently buried the body 
                of the great preacher, John's disciples go to Jesus, expecting to find in him a 
                leader to redress the Baptist's wrongs. They knew the friendship of John for 
                Jesus, and, knowing that the latter intended to set up a kingdom, they believed 
                that this would involve the overthrow of Herod's power. They were ready now to 
                revolt and make Jesus a king. See 
                <span class="style7">Matthew12: 13; John 6: 1, 2, 15</span>. But Jesus would not aid them to seek the bitter 
                fruits of revenge, nor did he intend to set up such a kingdom as they 
                imagined.</span>)
