        <h3>133. THE LORD'S PRAYER.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM. THURSDAY NIGHT.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 17.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to 
            heaven (<span class="comm">the action marked the turning of his thoughts from the disciples to 
                the Father</span>), he said, Father, the hour is come (<span class="comm">see pp. 116, 
                440</span>); glorify thy Son, that the son may glorify thee:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast 
            given him, he should give eternal life. (<span class="comm">The Son here prays for his 
                glorification, viz.: resurrection, ascension, coronation, etc., that through 
                these he may be perfected as a Saviour and be enabled to give that eternal life 
                unto millions, the bestowal of which will redound unto the glory of the Father. 
                Moreover, the glorification of Christ revealed his divine nature, and the 
                Father was glorified by its thus becoming apparent that he had bestowed upon 
                the world so priceless a gift. The gift of authority was bestowed after the 
                resurrection (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 28: 18</span></span>). All 
                humanity was given into his hands that he might give life to that part of it 
                which yielded itself to him in true discipleship.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And this is life 
            eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst 
            send, even Jesus Christ. 
            (<span class="comm">God is revealed in Jesus Christ: Jesus had just prayed for his glorification 
                that the Father may be fully revealed him him. The revelation of God is the 
                first step toward the attainment of eternal life. The inner reception of that 
                revelation by a daily conformity to it is the second step. As we actually live 
                God's life we come to know him; but we cannot attempt to live his life without 
                a revelation.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work 
            which thou hast given me to do.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And now, Father, glorify thou me 
            with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world 
            was. 

            (<span class="comm">As the hour for finishing his work had arrived, Jesus 
                speaks of it as already finished. As he had finished that for which he had 
                emptied himself of his glory and entered the world, he asks that now, on his 
                departure from the world, he may be reinstated and permitted to assume again 
                that which he had laid aside. Paul's words are commentary on these two verses 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Philippians 2: 5-11</span></span>). Thus Jesus 
                ends the first division of his prayer which is a petition for himself, for the 
                glory of the Father, and the good of the world. The second division which 
                follows is a fourfold plea for the disciples which he then had, followed by 
                petitions in their behalf.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou 
            gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me (<span class="comm">As 
                a first plea or reason why the Father should bless the disciples of the Son, 
                the Son urges that they are his property by gift of the Father. The Father is 
                possessor of all humanity as the Creator; the Son by gift from the Father 
                possesses the believing portion of humanity as its redeemer</span>); and 
            they have kept thy word.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> Now they know that all things 
            whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> for the words which 
            thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received them, and knew of a truth that I came forth 
            from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me. (<span class="comm">As a second reason 
                for blessing the disciples Jesus pleads their reception and retention of the 
                truth which the Father had sent him to reveal, and the resulting knowledge and 
                faith. The truth revealed by Jesus was so palpably divine that the disciples 
                could know that its bearer came from heaven. But whether that bearer came of 
                his own volition or as a commissioned messenger of the Father they could not 
                know. But where knowledge was impossible, they trusted to Jesus and believed.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast 
            given me; for they are thine:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> and all things that are mine are 
            thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them. (<span class="comm">As a third plea he 
                urges the joint possession which the Father held with 

                him in the 
                disciples, and the further fact that the Son was glorified in the disciples.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to 
            thee. (<span class="comm">As a last plea he urges the necessity of the Father's care over the 
                disciples since the Son will be no longer in the world to care for them.</span>) 
            Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be 
            one, even as we are. (<span class="comm">Our Lord's 
                first petition grows out of his last plea. His departure would tend to scatter 
                the disciples; they had been united by faith in the name of Christ, that is, by 
                the divine power given of God and revealed in Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 23: 21; Isaiah 9: 6; Jeremiah 23: 6</span></span>), and Jesus asks 
                that they may be still so kept, and that their unity may be as perfect as that 
                subsisting between the Father and the Son.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> While I was with them, I kept 
            them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of 
            them perished, but the son of perdition (<span class="comm">literally, son of perishing</span>)
            ; that the scripture might be fulfilled. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalm 41: 9</span>. Jesus emphasizes the fervency of his petition by 
                urging his own conduct as to that which he asks. He asks the Father to care for 
                those for whom he had himself been so painstakingly careful that not one had 
                been lost, save him whom it was impossible to save, and whose loss the 
                Scripture had predicted--a loss in no way chargeable against the loving 
                fidelity of the Good Shepherd.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> But now I come to thee; and these things 
            I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. 
            (<span class="comm">Being about ready to depart from the world, Jesus had taught and prayed for 
                his disciples that they might be brought into a oneness with the Father similar 
                to that which he himself enjoyed, and the consequent joy which filled his own 
                life might in some measure fill theirs also. This also was part of his care for 
                them.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they 
            are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. (<span class="comm">An additional reason 
                for the Father's care is here presented. The reception of the Father's word had 
                brought upon them the hatred of the world, thereby increasing their need of a 


                heavenly blessing, as a counter-balance to the curse of the world. 
                Jesus as advocate gives potency to his petitions as to the sufferings of his 
                disciples by suggesting that he has himself shared them--<span class="style7">Hebrews 2: 10-18</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> I pray not that 
            thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from 
            the evil one. (<span class="comm">The care which he 
                asks in protection in, and not removal from, the world. It is best both for the 
                Christian and for the world that he should remain in it. The world is blessed 
                by the Christian's presence (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 4: 14-16</span></span>), and abiding in the world affords the Christian an 
                opportunity of conquest and reward--<span class="style7">Romans 8: 37; Revelation 2: 26; 3: 21</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> They are not of the world even as I 
            am not of the world.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is 
            truth.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I 
            them into the world.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And for their sakes I sanctify myself, 
            that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. (<span class="comm">To sanctify means to 
                set apart to a holy use. As Jesus himself had been set apart as God's messenger 
                to the world, so he had set apart the apostles as his messengers to it. This 
                setting apart was not a formal, empty act, but was accomplished by God's 
                imparting or developing a fitness in the one sanctified to perform the duties 
                for which he was set apart. Fitness in this case would be imparted by imbuing 
                the apostles with the Spirit of truth. Jesus had set himself apart (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 9: 14</span></span>), that the apostles might follow his 
                example--<span class="style7">2 Corinthians 5: 14-17</span> (<span class="comm">and also the church--<span class="style7">Philippians 2: 5; Romans 12: 1-2</span> </span>), that thereby the world might be saved. Our Lord's prayer as 
                to the apostles is, therefore, a threefold petition, viz.: that they may be 
                kept in unity, kept from the world and the devil, and that they may be set 
                apart and equipped for the gospel service. We come now to the third division of 
                the prayer wherein he asks for blessings upon future believers.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> Neither 
            for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their 
            word;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> that they may all be one; even as thou, Father,
            art in me, and I in thee, that they 
            also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send 

            me. (<span class="comm">Here again the first petition is for unity, and again the 
                unity subsisting between the Father and the Son is designated as the kind 
                desired. That future disciples may understand the nature of this unity, Jesus 
                sets it forth in an amplified statement, which reveals the fact that he does 
                not ask for a unity similar to that subsisting between the Father and the Son, 
                but for that very unity itself enlarged and extended so as to become a triple 
                instead of a dual unity by the comprehension of the disciples within its 
                compass. As a reason why the Father should bring about this unity (<span class="comm">and a reason 
                    also why all Christians should work for it</span>), our Lord states that its 
                attainment will result in the conversion of the world to the Christian faith.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they 
            may be one, even as we are 
            one (<span class="comm">Jesus here states that to bring about the unity which he here prays 
                for he has bestowed upon the disciples the glory which the Father had bestowed 
                upon him. The glory mentioned was that of being the Son of God (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 3: 17; John 1: 14; Hebrews 1: 5; 3: 6</span></span>), 
                which glory Jesus imparts to his followers (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 12; 1 John 3: 1</span></span>). In other words, he made us his brethren that 
                we might be united in one great household (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 8: 29; Ephesians 1: 10; 2: 19; 1 John 3: 9-10; 4: 8, 16</span></span>). A true 
                comprehension of the Fatherhood of God and our brotherhood in Christ must 
                result in unity</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be 
            perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and 
            lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me. (<span class="comm">He here states that the perfect 
                unity of the church and the putting forth of its power in harmonious effort to 
                convert the world will be equivalent to a demonstration of the truth of his 
                divine mission. <span class="style7">John 17: 21</span> above asserts that the initial stages of unity will produce faith in the world, 
                and this verse adds that the perfection of that unity will lead the world 
                beyond faith into the realm of actual knowledge as to the divine mission of 
                Christ. The context suggests that this unity will result in gracious 
                manifestations of the Father's love. Possibly these manifestations may be of 
                such a nature as to aid in bringing about 

                the state of knowledge 
                mentioned.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be 
            with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: 
            for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. (<span class="comm">While Jesus prays 
                that his disciples may enter the heavenly state, that state is not expressed as 
                the end desired. He wishes them to be in that state that they may behold his 
                glory. The glory of Christ is his Sonship, and the love which accompanies that 
                relationship. To behold this is the height of spiritual exaltation. To know God 
                is life eternal, and to behold God is joy ineffable. God is truly beheld 
                subjectively. We must be like him to see him as he is (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 3: 2</span></span>). The second petition of Jesus, therefore, in no 
                way savors of a vainglorious desire that his disciples may behold him to lead 
                them to admire him, but a wish that they may participate in the heavenly state, 
                and know the Sonship of Jesus and all its attendant blessedness by, in some 
                measure, participating in it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span>  O righteous Father, the world knew thee 
            not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love 
            wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them. (<span class="comm">In theses closing 
                sentences Jesus blends his present and his future disciples. To his present 
                disciples he had made known the Father's name, and to the future ones he would 
                make it known. The knowledge which he had of the Father had been imparted to 
                the disciples, and they had received it, and had thereby been in some measure 
                fitted for the revelation of the glory for which he had just prayed. The world, 
                on the contrary, had rejected Christ's revelation, and had refused to know God, 
                and had thus become unworthy of the privilege here asked for the disciples. 
                Jesus had revealed the Father while on earth that men might attain to the 
                revelation of God in the hereafter, thus participating in the love which the 
                Father has for the Son because the Son is spiritually in them. It is a 
                significant fact that the two of the five petitions of this prayer are for 
                Christian unity. It may be said generally of all 

                the petitions 
                that they ask the Father to complete that which the Son has already begin and 
                completed to the limit of his present circumscribed power.</span>)
