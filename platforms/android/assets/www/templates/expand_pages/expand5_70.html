        <h3>70. HEALING BLIND MEN.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY CAPERNAUM.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 9: 27-34.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5"></span> 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> And as Jesus passed by from thence (<span class="comm">If 
                construed strictly, this phrase means, as he departed from Jairus' house. But 
                the phrase is indefinite</span>), two blind men followed him, crying out, 
            and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David. (<span class="comm">This, among the Jews, was 
                a common and thoroughly recognized name for the expected Messiah.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> And when he was come into the house (<span class="comm">possibly Peter's. But the place is not important. The house is mentioned to show that the blind men persistently followed Jesus until he stopped</span>), the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. (<span class="comm">In the earlier stages of his ministry Jesus had worked his miracles with little or no solicitation; but now, as the evidences of his power were multiplied, Jesus demanded a fuller expression of faith; for faith was the fruitage for which the miracles were wrought.</span>)</p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> Then touched he their 
            eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> And their 
            eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly (<span class="comm">sternly</span>) charged them, saying, See 
            that no man know it. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> But they went forth, and spread abroad his 
            fame in all that land. (<span class="comm">Jesus might well speak severely when charging his 
                beneficiaries to be silent, for apparently no one of them ever obeyed him.</span>)</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb man 
            possessed with a demon. </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> And when the demon was cast out, the 
            dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in 
            Israel. (<span class="comm">Some regard this demoniac as being the victim of combined physical 
                and spiritual maladies, but it is more likely that the dumbness was 

                caused by the demon, since in some instances they deprived men of 
                reason (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 5: 15</span></span>), and in others they 
                threw men into convulsions or distortions--<span class="style7">Mark 9: 18; Luke 13: 11, 16</span>.</span>) </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> But the Pharisees said, By 
            the prince of the demons casteth he out demons. (<span class="comm">If we are correct in our 
                chronology, Jesus had already fully answered this charge. See pages 
                300-302. If he repeated any part of this answer at this time, Matthew is 
                silent as to it.</span>)</p>
