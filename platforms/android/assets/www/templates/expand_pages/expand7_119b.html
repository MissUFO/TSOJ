        <h3>119B. THIRD GROUP OF PARABLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE. <br>TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>THE TWO SONS.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 21: 28-32.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span>  But what think ye? (<span class="comm">By these words Jesus put 
                them on notice that he was about to propound something which would require an 
                answer, and therefore demanding the 

                strictest attention.</span>) A man 
            had two sons (<span class="comm">the two sons stand for the Jewish rulers and the Jewish 
                common people</span>); and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work 
            to-day in the vineyard. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span>   And he answered and said, I will not: 
            but afterward he repented himself, and went. (<span class="comm">The common people made no 
                special pretension to religious excellence, and the rulers regarded them as 
                very careless about the will or law of their Father, God, and made disparaging 
                contrasts between their own conduct and that of the people (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 7: 48, 49</span></span>). But this very same common 
                people repented and did the will of God when they heard the preaching of John 
                the Baptist--<span class="style7">Matthew 3: 5, 6.</span></span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span>   And he came to the second (<span class="comm">the rulers</span>), and said likewise. And he 
            answered and said, I go, sir: 
            and went not. (<span class="comm">The rulers, though all the while professing to be very 
                zealous for the will of God, utterly refused to enter the kingdom or to work 
                therein as God bade them to by the voice of John the Baptist--<span class="style7">Matthew 3: 7-9.</span></span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span>   Which of the two did 
            the will of his father? They say, The first. (<span class="comm">They gave the true answer and 
                did not perceive that in so doing they confirmed a parable which condemned 
                themselves.</span>) Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the 
            publicans and the harlots (<span class="comm">the very worst representatives of the common 
                people</span>) go into the kingdom of God before you. (<span class="comm">Rather than you.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span>   For John came to you in the way of righteousness (<span class="comm">The term 
                "righteousness," as Plumptre observes, seems used in a 
                half-technical sense, as expecting the aspect of righteousness which the 
                Pharisees themselves recognized (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 6: 1</span></span>), and which includes, as its three great elements, the almsgiving, 
                fasting, and prayer that were so conspicuous both in the life and the teaching 
                of the Baptist. Surely they could have presented its demands in a form more 
                acceptable to the Jewish rulers</span>), and ye believed him not: but the 
            publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even 
            repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him. (<span class="comm">The parable of 
                this subdivision is 

                the outgrowth of the preceding subdivision. 
                These rulers had demanded that Jesus show his authority for his assumption of 
                right as teacher, prophet, etc. The parable is an indirect response to this 
                demand, as if Jesus said, "It is in vain for me to tell you that I act 
                under the authority of the Father, for despite all your great profession to the 
                contrary, you really and actually, in your persistent rejection of another (<span class="comm">the 
                    Baptist</span>), who also acted under it, repudiate utterly his authority; though in 
                so doing you see yourselves condemned by the conduct of even the publicans and 
                harlots, who have felt the force of the Father's authority, and have 
                repentantly obeyed it." The situation must have given great force to the 
                parable; for the rulers in their private conversation had just admitted to each 
                other that the people recognized and obeyed the divine authority of John, while 
                they, the rulers, rejected it.</span>)
