        <h3>48. HEAVENLY TREASURES.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 6: 19-34.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, 
            where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal. (<span class="comm">In 
                our Lord's time banks, such as we have, were unknown, and in order to keep 
                money its possessor frequently buried it, thus subjecting it to rust and 
                corrosion. The havoc caused by moths is too familiar to need comment (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Jasmes 5: 2</span></span>). Costly and ornamental apparel was 
                reckoned among a man's chief treasures in olden times. See <span class="style7">Joshua 7: 21; 2 Kings 5: 5; Luke 16: 19</span>. 
                Oriental houses were frequently made of loose stone or sun-dried bricks, so 
                that the thief found it easier to enter by digging through the wall than by 
                opening the barred door. A too literal compliance with this negative precept 
                would discourage thrift. The precept is not intended to discourage the 

                possession of property in moderation, but it forbids us to hoard for 
                selfish purposes, or to look upon our possessions as permanent and abiding. The 
                lives of many men of our day seem to be employed to no other purpose than that 
                of amassing an abundance of earthly treasure. But no true Christian can envy 
                them, or follow their example</span>): 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> but lay up for yourselves 
            treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where 
            thieves do not break through nor steal (<span class="comm">As the impossibility of hoarding 
                earthly treasures is in the preceding verse urged as a reason against it, so in this verse the possibility 
                of amassing perpetual possessions in heaven is set forth as the reason why we 
                should do it. Thus the striking contrast between the two kinds of treasures is 
                brought to our notice, so that it is the height of folly not to make a proper 
                choice between them</span>): 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> for where thy treasure is, there will thy 
            heart be also. (<span class="comm">Having contrasted the two treasures, Jesus here suggests 
                the contrast between the two places where they are stored up. Since the heart 
                follows the treasure, that it may dwell with the object of its love, we should 
                place our treasures in heaven, even if the treasures there were no better than 
                the treasures on earth; for it is better that our hearts should abide in the 
                city of God than on this sinful earth.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span>  The lamp of the body is the eye: 
            if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span>  But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. 
            If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the 
            darkness! (<span class="comm">In these two verses there is a brief allegory, the meaning of 
                which is to be ascertained from the context. The subject under consideration is 
                the propriety of laying up treasures, not on earth, but in heaven, and the 
                effect which treasures have upon the heart. Now, the heart or affection is to 
                the soul much the same as the eye is to the body. If we do not set our 
                affections upon spiritual things, the time quickly comes when we can not see 
                them (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 2: 14; John 3: 19-21</span></span>). Jesus therefore represents our affections as if they 
                were an eye. If the eye is single--i. e., 

                if it sees 
                nothing with a double or confused vision--then the man receives through it 
                clear views of the outside world, and his inner man is, so to speak, full of 
                light. But if his eye is diseased or blinded, then his inner man is likewise 
                darkened. Applying the allegory to the spiritual man, if his heart is single in 
                its love toward God and the things of God, then he has clear views as to the 
                relative importance and value of things temporal and eternal, things earthly 
                and things heavenly. But if the heart looks with a double interest upon both 
                earthly and heavenly treasure, it makes the man double-minded (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 1: 6-8</span></span>), and so spoils his life. God 
                does not permit a double affection any more than he does a double service, and 
                a man who seeks to continue in it will soon be visited with great darkness as 
                to the things of God, and will become blind in heart and 
                conscience--<span class="style7">Romans 1: 21-25</span>.</span>) 
        </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span>  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and 
            love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye 
            cannot serve God and mammon. (<span class="comm">Mammon was a common Chaldee word used in the 
                East to express material riches. It is here personified as a kind of god of 
                this world. Jesus here assumes that we are framed to serve (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 2: 15</span></span>); and hence that we must choose our 
                master, for it is impossible to serve two masters whose interests are different 
                and conflicting. They conflict here, for it is mammon's interest to be hoarded 
                and loved, but it is God's interest that mammon be distributed to the needy and 
                be lightly esteemed. God claims our supreme love and our undivided service.</span>)
        </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span>  Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, 
            or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the 
            life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? (<span class="comm">The word 
                "anxious" is derived from a word which indicates a state of doubt 
                or double-mindedness. It therefore indicates that sense of suspense or worry 
                which comes from a mind in doubt. Compare <span class="style7">Luke 12: 29</span>. Hence we may say that Jesus is here continuing the 
                contrasts of the preceding verses, and 
                that, having warned 

                against a double vision and a double service, 
                he now warns against a double mind as to the comparative value of the benefits 
                to be derived from the service of God or the service of mammom. Mammon can only 
                supply food, but God gives the life; mammon can only furnish clothing, but God 
                gives the body. By single-mindedness we can find peace, for God is to be relied 
                upon. By double-mindedness we fall to worrying, for mammon may fail to supply 
                those things which we feel we need.</span>) 
        </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span>  Behold the birds of the heaven they 
            sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father 
            feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value then they? (<span class="comm">Literally, do ye 
                not greatly excel them. The birds do not serve mammon at all, yet God feeds 
                them. Surely, then, man who excels the birds both in his intrinsic value and in 
                his capacity for temporal and eternal service, can expect to receive from God 
                his sufficient food.</span>) 
        </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span>  And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit 
            unto the measure of his life? (<span class="comm">Peace and trust characterize the service of 
                God. The rewards of mammon, on the contrary, are won by anxiety. But the 
                rewards of mammon can not lengthen life as can God. Therefore we should not 
                hesitate to choose God's service.</span>)
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span>  And why are ye anxious concerning 
            raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, 
            neither do they spin: 
        </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span>  yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in 
            all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. (<span class="comm">The magnificence of 
                Solomon and of his court is proverbial in the East unto this day. To the Jew he 
                was the highest representative of earthly grandeur, yet he was surpassed by the 
                common lily of the field. Which lily is here meant can not be determined. 
                Calcott thinks it was the fragrant white lily which grows profusely all over 
                Palestine. Smith favors the scarlet martagon; Tristam, the anemone coronaria; 
                and Thomson, the Huleh lily, a species of iris. It is likely, however, that 
                scholars are trying to draw distinctions where Jesus himself drew none. It is 
                highly probable that in popular speech many of the common 

                spring 
                flowers were loosely classes together under the name lily.</span>)
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span>  But if God 
            doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast 
            into the oven, shall he not much 
            more clothe you, O ye of little 
            faith? (<span class="comm">"This is the only term of reproach Jesus applied to his 
                disciples" (<span class="comm">Bengel</span>). As to the grass and oven we may say that the 
                forests of Palestine had been cleared off centuries earlier, and the people 
                were accustomed to use the dried grass, mingled with wild flowers and weeds, 
                for fuel. The oven was a large, round pot of earthenware, or other material, 
                two or three feet high, and narrowing toward the top. This was first heated by 
                fire within, after which the fire was raked out, and the dough put inside. Such 
                is still the universal practice.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span>  Be not therefore anxious, saying, What 
            shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 
            (<span class="comm">God's care for the grass which lasts but for a day should teach us to expect 
                that he will show more interest in providing for those who have been fashioned 
                for eternity.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span>  For after all these things do the Gentiles seek. 
            (<span class="comm">Christians having a heavenly Father to supply their wants, should not live 
                like the Gentiles, who have no consciousness of such a Father. Of what use is 
                all our religious knowledge if we are still as careworn and distrustful as the 
                benighted heathen?</span>); for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have 
            need of all these things. (<span class="comm">Here is the panacea for anxiety. Being God, the 
                Supreme One knows; being a Father, he feels. Many repose with confidence upon 
                the regularity and beneficence of his providential laws; but far sweeter is 
                that assurance which arises from a sense of God's personal interest in our 
                individual welfare--an interest manifested by the gift of his Son.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span>  
            But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things 
            shall be added unto you. (<span class="comm">The kingdom of heaven is the real object of our 
                search. It must be sought first both in point of time and of interest, and it 
                must be kept ever first in our thoughts after it is found. That Christian faith 
                and obedience leads to worldly prosperity is proved by countless 

                instances which are multiplied with each succeeding day. The security of 
                Christ's kingdom leads to that cheerfulness which renews the strength, and to 
                that undistracted industry which brings success.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span>  Be not therefore 
            anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient 
            unto the day is the evil thereof. (<span class="comm">Each day has trouble enough without 
                adding to it by borrowing somewhat from the morrow. Serve God to-day with the 
                strength you used to expend in carrying troubles which you borrowed from the 
                future, and God will order the affairs of to-morrow.</span>)
