        <h3>39. HEALING ON THE SABBATH.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 12: 9-14;  MARK 3: 1-6;  LUKE 6: 6-11.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 9</span> And he departed thence. (<span class="comm">The word here points to a journey as in <span class="style7">Matthew 11: 1</span> and <span class="style7">Matthew 15: 29</span>, 
                which are the only places where Matthew uses this expression. Greswell may be 
                right in thinking that it indicates the return back to Galilee from the 
                Passover, since a cognate expression used by John expresses such a journey from 
                Galilee to Jud&aelig;a. See <span class="style7">John 7: 3</span></span>),

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 6</span> And it came to pass on another 
            sabbath (<span class="comm">another sabbath than that on which the disciples plucked the 
                grain</span>), that he entered  againand went into their {the} synagogue and 
            taught (<span class="comm">The use of the pronoun "their" indicates that the 
                synagogue in question was under the control of the same Pharisee who had 
                caviled about plucking grain on the Sabbath. Where the synagogue was is not 
                known. Some argue that from the presence of Herodians it was at Sepphoris, 
                which was then capital of Herod Antipas. But Herodians were likely to be found 
                everywhere.</span>):

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 10</span> and behold,there was a man who had {having} a {his} hand withered.  and his 
            right hand was withered. (<span class="comm">The hand had dried up from insufficient 
                absorption of nutriment, until its power was gone, and there was no remedy 
                known by which it could be restored.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 2</span> And 
            they  the scribes and the Pharisees watched him,
            whether he would heal him on the sabbath day;  that they might find how to accuse him. (<span class="comm">They sought to 
                accuse him before the local judges or officers of the synagogue; i. e., 
                before a body of which they themselves were members. Jesus gave them abundant 
                opportunity for such accusation, for we have seven recorded 

                instances of cures on the sabbath day; viz.: <span class="style7">Mark 1: 21, 29; John 5: 9; 9: 14; Luke 13: 14; 14: 2</span>, and this 
                case.</span>)   And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal 
            on the sabbath day? (<span class="comm">They were afraid that Jesus might not notice the man, 
                so they spoke about him. But, taught by their experience in the grainfield, 
                they changed their bold assertion, "It is not lawful," and 
                approached the subject with a guarded question, hoping to get an answer that 
                could be used as a ground for accusation.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 8</span> But 
            he knew their thoughts (<span class="comm">omnisciently</span>); and he said to {saith unto} the man that had his hand withered,  Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood 
            forth. (<span class="comm">Jesus thus placed the man openly before all the people, as though 
                he stood on trial as to his right to be healed on the sabbath day.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 11</span> And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, 
            that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will 
            he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 12</span> How much then is a man 
            of more value than a sheep! (<span class="comm">A man who had but one sheep would set a high 
                value upon it. But the most valuable sheep is not to be weighed in the balance 
                against a man. The fact that Jesus used this illustration shows clearly that 
                such an action was allowed at that time, though the rabbins forbade it 
                afterward.</span>) Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 9</span> And Jesus said {saith} 
            unto them,  I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath
            day to do good, or to do harm? to save life, or to kill? 
            {destroy it?} (<span class="comm">The rules of the Pharisees made 
                the Sabbath question wholly a matter of doing or of not doing. But Jesus made 
                it a question of doing good, and his question implies that a failure to do 
                good, when one is able, is harmful and sinful. "The ability," says 
                Cotton Mather, "to do good imposes an obligation to do it." To 
                refrain from healing in such an instance would have been to abstain from using 
                a power given him for that very purpose. The Jews held it lawful to defend 
                themselves on the Sabbath, and considered themselves justified in killing their 
                enemies if they 

                attacked on that day (<span class="comm">1 Maccabees 2: 41; Josephus 
                    Antiquities 12: 6: 2</span>).   But they held their peace. (<span class="comm">afraid 
                    to say that Jesus was wrong and stubbornly unwilling to admit that he was 
                    right.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 5</span> And when he had looked round about on them  
                    all,  with anger, being grieved at the hardening of 
                    their heart (<span class="comm">The anger of Jesus was not a spiteful, revengeful passion, but 
                        a just indignation (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ephesians 4: 26</span></span>). God 
                        may love the sinner, but he is angry at sin. Anger is not sin, but it is apt to 
                        run into it: hence it is a dangerous passion. Righteous anger rises from the 
                        love of God and man, but that which rises from self-love is sinful</span>), 
                    he saith {said}

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 13</span> Then unto him,  
                    the man, Stretch forth thy hand.  And he did
                    so: he 
                    stretched it forth; and it  his hand was restored.
                    whole, as the other. (<span class="comm">As Jesus here healed without 
                        any word or action of healing, merely ordering the man to stretch forth his 
                        hand, the Pharisees could find no legal ground for accusation. God can not be 
                        tried by man, because his ways are hidden from the senses of man save as he 
                        chooses to reveal them.</span>)

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 6: 11</span> But they were filled 
                    with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.

                <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 6</span> And the Pharisees went out, 
                    and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might 
                    destroy him. (<span class="comm">Here the three Synoptists first tell of the counsel to put 
                        Jesus to death, and we should note that, like John, they described the anger of 
                        the Jewish rulers as arising because of this Sabbath question. Their real 
                        motive was envious hatred, but their pretext was a zeal for the law. That it 
                        was not genuine zeal for the law is shown by the fact that they consulted with 
                        the Herodians or the adherents of Herod Antipas, as they also did afterwards 
                        (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 22: 16; Mark 12: 13</span></span>). They 
                        needed the secular power of the Herodians to secure the death of Jesus. Its 
                        efficiency for such ends had just been shown in the imprisonment of John the 
                        Baptist. But the Herodians were no friends of the Jewish law; in fact, they 
                        were real perverters of that law which Jesus merely correctly interpreted. This 
                        party and its predecessors had 

                        flatteringly tried to make a 
                        Messiah of Herod the Great, and had been friends of Rome and patrons of Gentile 
                        influence. They favored the erection of temples for idolatrous ends, and pagan 
                        theaters and games, and Gentile customs generally. Unlike Jesus, the Pharisees 
                        grew angry and sinned, for it was against their conscience to consort with the 
                        Herodians.</span>)
