        <h3>61. THE TRUE FAMILY.</h3>
        <h3>GALILEE, SAME DAY AS THE LAST LESSON.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 12: 46-50;  MARK 3: 31-35;  LUKE 8: 19-21.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 46</span>   While he yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, 
            his mother and his brethren stood without seeking to speak to him. (<span class="comm">Jesus 
                was in a house, probably at Capernaum--<span class="style7">Mark 3: 19; Matthew 13: 1.</span></span>)   
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 19</span>   and there came 
            {come}  to him his mother 
            and  his brethren;  and they 
            could not come at him for the crowd.  and, standing 
            without, they sent unto him, calling him. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 32</span>   And the multitude was 
            sitting about him (<span class="comm">We learn at <span class="style7">Mark 3: 21</span>, that they came to lay hold of him because they thought that he 
                was beside himself. It was for this reason that they came in a body, for their 
                numbers would enable them to control him. Jesus had four brethren (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 13: 55</span></span>). Finding him teaching with the 
                crowd about him, they passed the word in to him that they wished to see him 
                outside. To attempt to lay hold of him in the midst of his disciples would have 
                been rashly inexpedient. The fact that they came with Mary establishes the 
                strong presumption that they were the children of Mary and Joseph, and hence 
                the literal brethren of the Lord. In thus seeking to take Jesus away from his 
                enemies Mary yielded to a natural maternal impulse which even the revelations 
                accorded to her did not quiet. The brethren, too, acted naturally, for they 
                were unbelieving--<span class="style7">John 7: 5.</span></span>) 


        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 47</span>   And one said {they say} unto him, </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 8: 20</span>   And it was told him,
            Behold, thy mother and thy brethren  
            seek for thee.  stand without, desiring to see thee.
            seeking to speak to thee. 

            (<span class="comm">This message 
                was at once an interruption and an interference. It assumed that their business 
                with him was more urgent than his business with the people. It merited our 
                Lord's rebuke, even if it had not behind it the even greater presumption of an 
                attempt to lay hold on him.</span>) 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 12: 48</span> But he answered {<span class="style5">Mark 3: 33</span> And he answereth} and said unto him that told him, and saith, {and said unto them,} Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 3: 34</span>   And looking round on them that sat round about him,  he 
            stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, {saith,}  Behold, my mother and my brethren!
            My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of 
            God and do it. </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span>  For 
            whosoever shall do the will of God,  my Father who in 
            heaven, he {the same} is my brother, and my sister, 
            and mother. (<span class="comm">In this answer Jesus shows that he brooks no interference on 
                the score of earthly relationships, and explodes the idea of his subserviency 
                to his mother. To all who call on the "Mother of God," as Mary is 
                blasphemously styled, Jesus answers, as he did to the Jews, "Who is my 
                mother?" Jesus was then in the full course of his ministry as Messiah, 
                and as such he recognized only spiritual relationships. By doing the will of 
                God we become his spiritual children, and thus we become related to Christ. 
                Jesus admits three human relationships--"brother, sister, 
                mother"--but omits the paternal relationship, since he had no 
                Father, save God. It is remarkable that in the only two instances in which Mary 
                figures in the ministry of Jesus prior to his crucifixion, she stands forth 
                reproved by him. This fact not only rebukes those who worship her, but 
                especially corrects the doctrine of her immaculate conception.</span>)
