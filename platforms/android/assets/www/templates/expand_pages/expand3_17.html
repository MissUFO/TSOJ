        <h3>17. JOHN'S TESTIMONY.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">BETHANY BEYOND JORDAN, FEBRUARY, A.D. 27.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>JOHN 1: 19-34.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> And this is the witness of John (<span class="comm">John had been 
                sent to testify, "and" this is the matter of his testimony</span>), 
            when the Jews (<span class="comm">The term "Jews" is used seventy times by John 
                to describe the ruling classes of Jud&aelig;a</span>) sent unto him (<span class="comm">In thus 
                sending an embassy they honored John more than they ever honored Christ. They 
                looked upon John as a priest and Jud&aelig;an, but upon Jesus as a carpenter 
                and Galil&aelig;an. It is probable that the sending of this investigating 
                committee marks the period when the feelings of the rulers toward John changed 
                from friendliness to hostility. At the first, probably led on by the prophecies 
                of Daniel, these Jews found joy in 

                John's coming (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 33-35</span></span>). When they attended his 
                ministry in person he denounced their wickedness and incurred their hatred</span>) 
            from Jerusalem priests and Levites (<span class="comm">they were commissioned to teach 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Chronicles 15: 3; Nehemiah 8: 7-9</span></span>), and it was probably because of their wisdom as teachers that they were sent 
                to question John about his baptism</span>) to ask him, Who art thou? 
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed (<span class="comm">The repetition here 
                suggests John's firmness under repeated temptation. As the questioners ran down 
                the scale from "Christ" to "that prophet," John felt 
                himself diminishing in their estimation, but firmly declined to take honors 
                which did not belong to him</span>), I am not (<span class="comm">in this entire section 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 20-24</span></span>) John places 
                emphasis upon the pronoun "I," that he may contrast himself with 
                Christ</span>) the Christ (<span class="comm">When the apostle John wrote this Gospel it had 
                become fashionable with many of the Baptist's disciples to assert that the 
                Baptist was the Christ. (<span class="comm">Recognitions of Clement 1. 50, 60; Olshausen, 
                    Hengstenberg, Godet.</span>) In giving this testimony of the Baptist, John corrects 
                this error; but his more direct purpose is to show forth John's full testimony, 
                and give the basis for the words of Jesus found at <span class="style7">John 5: 33</span>. The fact that the Jews were disposed to look upon John 
                as the Messiah gave all the greater weight to his testimony; for the more 
                exalted the person of the witness, the weightier are his words. John's own 
                experience doubtless caused him to feel the influence of the Baptist's 
                testimony.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? (<span class="comm">Malachi 
                had declared that Elijah should precede the Messiah (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Malachi 4: 5</span></span>). The Jews interpreted this prophecy literally, and 
                looked for the return of the veritable Elijah who was translated (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 17: 10</span></span>). This literal Elijah did return, 
                and was seen upon the Mount of Transfiguration before the crucifixion of our 
                Lord. But the prophecy of Malachi referred to a spiritual Elijah--one who 
                should come "in the spirit and power of Elijah," and in this sense 
                John fulfilled Malachi's prediction--<span class="style7">Luke 1: 17; Matt. 11: 14; 17: 12</span>.</span>) And he saith, I am not (<span class="comm">He 
                answered their question according to 

                the sense in which they had 
                asked it. He was not the Elijah who had been translated about nine hundred 
                years before this time.</span>) Art thou the prophet? (<span class="comm">Moses had foretold a 
                prophet who should come (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 18: 
                        15-18</span></span>), but the Jews appear to have had no fixed opinion 
                concerning him, for some thought he would be a second Moses, others a second 
                Elijah, others the Messiah. The Scriptures show us how uncertain they were 
                about him (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 16: 14; John 6: 14; 7: 40- 
                        41</span></span>). As to Jeremiah being that prophet, see <span class="style7">2 Maccabees 2: 7</span>. Even 
                Christians disagree as to whether Moses refers to Christ or to a line of 
                prophets. Though divided in opinion as to who this prophet would be, the Jews 
                were fairly unanimous as to what he would do. Finding in their Scriptures two 
                pictures of the Christ, one representing him as a great Conqueror, and the 
                other of his priesthood, setting him forth as a great Sufferer, they took the 
                pictures to refer to two personages, one denoting a king--the 
                Messiah--and the other a prophet. The Jews to this day thus divide the 
                Christ of prophecy, and seek to make him two personages.</span>) And he answered, 
            No. (<span class="comm">He was not the prophet, either as he or they understood that term. 
                John gives us a beautiful example of humility. Like Paul, he would not be 
                overvalued--<span class="style7">Acts 14: 13-15; 1 Corinthians 
                    1: 12-13</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that 
            we may give an answer to them that sent us What sayest thou of thyself? 
            (<span class="comm">Unable to guess his office, they asked him to state it plainly.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> He 
            said, I am the voice (<span class="comm">It is as though John answered, "You ask who I 
                am. My personality is nothing; my message everything. I shall pass away as a 
                sound passes into silence; but the truth which I have uttered shall 
                abide." In his answer John shows himself to be the spiritual Elijah, for 
                he declares that he came to do the work of Elijah; viz.: to prepare the people 
                for the advent of Messiah. There are many echoes in the world; but few voices</span>) 
            of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord 
            (<span class="comm">prepare the minds and hearts of the people that Christ may freely enter in</span>)
            , as said Isaiah the prophet. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 40: 
                    3</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> And they had been sent were from 

            The 
            Pharisees. (<span class="comm">Of all the Jewish sects the Pharisees were most attentive to 
                external rites and ceremonies, and hence would notice John's baptism more than 
                would others. It is interesting to notice that the Pharisees, who were Christ's 
                most bitter opponents, were warned of John about the presence of Messiah from 
                the very beginning.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then 
            baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the 
            prophet? (<span class="comm">If you are no more important personage, who do you presume to 
                introduce any other ordinance than those provided for by the law of Moses? The 
                question shows that to them John's baptism was a new rite. Even if proselyte 
                baptism then existed at this time (<span class="comm">of which there is certainly no sufficient 
                    evidence</span>), it differed in two marked ways from John's baptism: 1. John baptized 
                his converts, while proselytes baptized themselves. 2. John baptized Jews and 
                not Gentiles.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: but in the 
            midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> even he that cometh after me (<span class="comm">that is, 
                follows in that way which I as forerunner am preparing for him</span>), The 
            latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose. (<span class="comm">The words 
                "standeth" and "shoe" showed that the person of whom 
                the Baptist spoke had a visible, bodily form. To loose the latchet was a 
                peculiarly servile office. The Talmud says, "Every office a servant will 
                do for his master, a scholar should perform for his teacher, except loosing his 
                sandal-thong." The greatest prophet felt unworthy to render Christ this 
                humble service, but unconverted sinners often presume to serve Christ according 
                to their own will, and fully expect to have their service honored and rewarded. 
                Taken as a whole, the answer of John appears indirect and insufficient. What 
                was there in all this to authorize him to baptize? This appears to be his 
                meaning: "You demand my authority for baptism. It rests in him for whom I 
                prepare the way. It is a small matter to introduce baptism in water for one so 
                worthy. If you accept him, my baptism will need no explanation; and if you 
                reject him, my rite and its authority are both wholly 

                immaterial."</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> These things were done in Bethany beyond the 
            Jordan (<span class="comm">Owing to variation in the manuscripts, we may read 
                "Bethany" or "Bethabara," or even possibly 
                "Bethabara in Bathania." Tradition fixes upon the Jericho ford, 
                which is about five miles on an air line north of the Dead Sea, as the site of 
                Jesus' baptism. But this spot is eighty miles from Cana of Galilee, and hence 
                Jesus, leaving it on foot, could not well have attended the wedding in Cana on 
                "the third day" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 2: 1</span></span>). We must therefore look for Bethany or Bethabara farther up the river. John 
                the Baptist was a roving preacher (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 3: 
                        3</span></span>), and during the forty days of Jesus' temptation seems to have 
                moved up the river Jordan. Fifty miles above the Jericho ford, and ten miles 
                south of the Sea of Galilee, Lieutenant Conder found a ford named 'Abarah 
                (<span class="comm">meaning "ferry"</span>), which answers to Bethabara (<span class="comm">meaning "house 
                    of the ferry"</span>). It was in the land of Bashan, which in the time of Christ 
                was called Bathania (<span class="comm">meaning "soft soil"</span>). This spot is only 
                twenty-two miles from Cana. Being beyond the Jordan, it is not in 
                Galilee, as Dr. Thomson asserts. Conder says: "We have collected the 
                names of over forty fords, and no other is called 'Abarah; nor does the word 
                occur again in all nine thousand names collected by the survey party."</span>) 
            where John was baptizing.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> On the morrow he seeth Jesus 
            coming unto him (<span class="comm">Jesus had just returned from the temptation in the 
                wilderness. This is his first appearance in John's Gospel. The fact that John 
                leaves out all the early history of Jesus shows that he wrote many years after 
                the other evangelists, when all these facts were so well known as to need no 
                mention by him</span>), and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God (<span class="comm">Lambs were 
                commonly used for sin-offerings (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 4: 
                        32</span></span>), and three of them were sacrificed in the cleansing of a leper 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 14: 10</span></span>). A lamb was also the 
                victim of the morning (<span class="comm">9 A. M.</span>) and evening (<span class="comm">3 P. M.</span>) sacrifice (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 29: 38</span></span>)--the hours when Jesus was 
                nailed to the cross and when he expired. A lamb was also the victim at the 
                paschal supper. The great prophecy of Isaiah, setting forth the vicarious 
                sacrifice of Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Isaiah 53: 
                        1-12</span></span>) depicts him as a lamb, and in 

                terms which 
                answer closely to the words here used by John. The Jews to whom John spoke 
                readily understood his allusion as being to sacrificial lambs; but they could 
                not understand his meaning, for they had no thought of the sacrifice of a 
                person. Jesus is called the Lamb of God because he is the lamb or sacrifice 
                which God provided and accepted as the true and only 
                sin-offering--<span class="style7">Hebrews 10: 4-14; 1 Peter 
                    1: 19</span></span>), that taketh away the sin of the world! (<span class="comm">The 
                present tense, "taketh," is used because the expiatory effect of 
                Christ's sacrifice is perpetual, and the fountain of his forgiveness never 
                fails. Expiated sin is this spoken of as being taken away (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Leviticus 10: 17; Exodus 34: 7; Numbers 14: 18</span></span>). Some, 
                seeking to avoid the vicarious nature of Christ's sacrifice, claim that the 
                Baptist means that Jesus would gradually lift the world out of sin by his 
                teaching. But lambs do not teach, and sin is not removed by teaching, but by 
                sacrifice (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 9: 22; Revelation 5: 9</span></span>). 
                Jesus was sacrificed for the world, that is, for the entire human family in all 
                ages. All are bought, but all do not acknowledge the purchase (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Peter 2: 1</span></span>). He gives liberty to all, but all 
                do not receive it, and some having received it return again to bondage 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Galatians 4: 9</span></span>). The Baptist had baptized 
                for the remission of sins. He now points his converts to him who would make 
                this promise good unto their souls. A Christian looks upon Christ as one who 
                has taken away his past sin (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Peter 2: 24</span></span>), and who will forgive his present sin--<span class="style7">1 John 1: 9</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> This is he of whom I said 
            (<span class="comm">for this saying see<span class="style7"> John 1: 15, 27</span></span>)
            , After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before 
            me. (<span class="comm">As a man John was six months older than Jesus, but Jesus was the 
                eternal Word. The Baptist therefore asserts here the pre-existence of our 
                Lord.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> And I knew him not (<span class="comm">had no such certain knowledge of him as 
                would fit me to testify concerning him</span>); but that he should be made 
            manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water. (<span class="comm">John 
                baptized not only that he himself might know Christ by the spiritual sign, but 
                also that through that knowledge duly published all Israel might know him.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> And John bare witness, 

            saying, I have beheld the Spirit 
            descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him. (<span class="comm">The descent of 
                the Spirit served at least two purposes: 1. It enabled John to identify the 
                Messiah. 2. It was, so to speak, an official recognition of Jesus as Messiah 
                similar to the anointing or crowning of a king. It is asserted by some that it 
                was of no benefit to Jesus, since his own divine powers permitted of no 
                addition; but the language of Scripture indicates otherwise--<span class="style7">Isaiah 11: 2-3; Luke 4: 17-19; John 3: 34</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> And I knew him not (<span class="comm">John's assertions that he did not know Jesus 
                are assertions that he did not know him to be the Messiah. He believed 
                it, as appears from his reluctance to baptize him, but he did not know it. His 
                language to the people shows this (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 
                        26</span></span>). Many of the people must have known Jesus, but none of them knew 
                him to be the Messiah. Moreover, when John denied that he knew Jesus as Messiah 
                we must not take it that he was ignorant of the past history of Jesus. No doubt 
                he knew in a general way who Jesus was; but as the official forerunner and 
                announcer of Jesus, and as the heaven-sent witness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 6-7</span></span>), it was necessary that the Baptist should receive, by 
                personal revelation from God, as here stated, an indubitable, absolute 
                knowledge of the Messiahship of Jesus. Without this, John would not have been 
                truly qualified as a witness. That Jesus is the Son of God must not rest on 
                hearsay evidence. John kept silent till he could testify of his own 
                knowledge</span>): but he that sent me (<span class="comm">thus humbly does John claim his 
                divine commission as a prophet</span>) to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon 
            whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him (<span class="comm">John 
                seems to emphasize the abiding of the Spirit. The Spirit of God was also 
                bestowed upon the prophets and the apostles, but in them his power was 
                intermittent, and not constant; visions came to them intermittently, but with 
                Christ the fellowship of the Spirit was continuous</span>), the same is he 
            that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit. (<span class="comm">Christ bestows the Spirit upon his own. 
                If he himself received the Spirit at the time of his baptism, why should 

                it be thought strange that he bestows the Spirit upon his disciples at 
                the time of their baptism?--<span class="style7">See Acts 2: 38; 
                    19: 1-7; Titus 3: 5</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> And I have seen (<span class="comm">that is, I 
                have seen the promised sign</span>), and have borne witness that this is the 
            Son of God. (<span class="comm">This is the climax of John's testimony. It was twofold, 
                embracing the results of the two senses of sight and hearing. 1. John saw
                the dove-like apparition of the Spirit, which convinced him that Jesus was the 
                one to baptize in the Spirit. 2. He heard the voice of the Father, which 
                convinced him that Jesus was the Son of God. As to each of these two facts he 
                had a separate revelation, appealing to a different sense, and each given by 
                the personage of the Deity more nearly concerned in the matter revealed. John 
                was not only to prepare the people to receive Christ by calling them to 
                repentance, and baptizing them for the remission of their sins; there was 
                another work equally great and important to be performed. Their heads as 
                well as their hearts needed his preparatory services. His testimony ran 
                counter to and corrected popular opinion concerning Christ. We see that John 
                corrected four errors: 1. The Jews looked for a Messiah of no greater spiritual 
                worthiness than John himself, but the Baptist disclaimed even the right to 
                unlace the Lord's shoe, that he might emphasize the difference between himself 
                and the Messiah in point of spiritual excellency. 2. The Jews looked for one 
                who would come after Moses, David, and the prophets, and lost sight of the fact 
                that he would be before them, both in point of time and of honor (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 22: 41-46</span></span>). 3. The Jews looked 
                for a liberator from earthly bondage--a glorious king; John pointed them 
                to a liberator from spiritual bondage, a perfect sacrifice acceptable to God. 
                4. The Jews looked for a human Messiah, a son of David. John enlarged their 
                idea, by pointing them to a Messiah who was also the Son of God. When the Jews 
                accept John's guidance as a prophet, they will believe in the Messiahship of 
                Jesus.</span>)</p>
