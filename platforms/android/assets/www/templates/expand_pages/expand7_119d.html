        <h3>119D. GROUP OF PARABLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE. <br>TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING'S SON.</h3>
        <h3>MATT. 22: 1-14.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span>   And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto 
                them, saying, </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span>   The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain 
                king, who made a marriage feast for his son, </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span>   and sent forth his 
                servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would 
                not come. </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span>   Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them 
                that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings 
                are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast. </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span>   But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another 
                to his merchandise; </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span>   and the rest laid hold on his servants, and 
                treated them shamefully, and killed them. </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span>   But the king was 
                wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their 
                city. </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span>   Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but 
                they that were bidden were not worthy. </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span>   Go ye therefore unto the 
                partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage 
                feast. </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span>   And those servants went out into the highways, and 
                gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding 
                was filled with guests. (<span class="comm">This parable is very 

                    much like the 
                    one given in <span class="style7">Luke 14: 16-24 </span>--see pp. 495-497. </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span>   But when the king 
                came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man (<span class="comm">this one man is a type of 
                    many--see <span class="style7">Matthew 22 14 </span></span>) who had not 
                on a wedding-garment: </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span>   and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest 
                thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless. (<span class="comm">We are 
                    of the opinion that the king furnished upper garments to his guests. But the 
                    antiquity of this custom is disputed. See Meyer, Lange and Trench, etc. in 
                    loco. However, the fact is immaterial, for the man was 
                    speechless--without excuse--which shows that he could have had a 
                    garment from some source had he chosen to wear it.</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span>   Then the king said to 
                the servants, Bind him hand and foot (<span class="comm">the phrase suggests the impossibility 
                    of escaping from divine judgment</span>), and cast him out into the outer 
                darkness (<span class="comm">the outdoor darkness: wedding feasts were usually held at 
                    night</span>); there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
            </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span>   For many are called, but few chosen. (<span class="comm">Many guests are invited, 
                    but few are accepted; because some neglect and despise the invitation, and 
                    others cast dishonor upon the one who invites, by the self-willed and 
                    irreverent way in which they accept his invitation. In this parable the first 
                    parties invited represent the Jews; the city of murderers is Jerusalem; the 
                    persons called from the highways are the Gentiles; the entrance of the king is 
                    the coming of the Lord to final judgment; and 

                    the man without the 
                    wedding-garment is anyone who will be found in the church without a suitable 
                    character. The character of Christ is our wedding-garment, and all the 
                    regenerated must wear it--<span class="style7">Ephesians 4: 24; Colossians 3: 10; Galatians 3: 27; John 3: 5; Revelation 19: 8, 9. </span></span>)
