        <h3>149. FIFTH APPEARANCE OF JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">JERUSALEM. SUNDAY EVENING</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MARK 16: 14;  LUKE 24: 36-43; JOHN 20: 19-25.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 16: 14</span> And afterward as they spake these things (<span class="comm">while the two from Emmaus were telling their story</span>), he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat;        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 20: 19</span> When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were 
            shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus  
            himself  came and stood in the midst,  of them, and saith unto them, Peace 
            be unto you.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 37</span> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. (<span class="comm">His entrance through a bolted door lent weight to their idea that he had no corporeal body. They knew nothing of the possibilities of a resurrected body.</span>) and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart (<span class="comm">here, as in the previous section, Jesus shows that the heart has much to do with the belief</span>), because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen. (<span class="comm">They had had the testimony of three men and perhaps a half dozen women; they had not lacked evidence.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 38</span> And 
            he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in 
            your heart?
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 39</span> See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: 
            handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me 
            having.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 40</span> And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. and his side. (<span class="comm">These members not only showed that he was not a disembodied spirit, but they served to identify his body with that which they had seen crucified, and hence the person who now spoke was the Jesus whom they had known and lost.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 41</span> And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, 
            he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 42</span> And they gave 
            him a piece of a broiled fish.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 24: 43</span> And he took it, and ate before them. (<span class="comm">Thus at last satisfying them that he was not a ghost.</span>) The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 20: 21</span> Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace 
            be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I 
            you.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 20: 22</span> And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith 
            unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 20: 23</span> whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. (<span class="comm">Now that the apostles knew their Master, he repeats his blessing, and as the New Testament is now sealed in his blood according to the commission under which he came, he, in turn, commissions the twelve to go forth and proclaim its provisions. Symbolic of the baptism which they were to receive at Pentecost, he breathes upon them, and, having thus symbolically qualified them, he commissions them to forgive or retain sin, for this was the subject-matter of the New Testament.</span>)        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 20: 24</span> But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus (<span class="comm">see p. 244</span>), was not with them when Jesus came.        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">John 20: 25</span> The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe. (<span class="comm">The apostles had undoubtedly seen and talked with someone, but the question was, Who? They said that it was Jesus, and Thomas, holding this to be impossible, thought that it must have been someone else whom they mistook for Jesus. But he would not be deceived; he would thoroughly examine the wounds, for these would identify Jesus beyond all doubt--if it were Jesus.</span>)        </p>
