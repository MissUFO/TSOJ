        <h3>110. JESUS BLESS THE CHILDREN.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 19: 13-15;  MARK 10: 13-16;  LUKE 18: 15-17.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 19: 13</span> Then were there brought 




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 10: 13</span> And they were bringing  
            unto him little children, {also their babes,} that he 
            should touch them:  that he should lay his hands on 
            them, and pray (<span class="comm">According to Buxtorf, children were often brought to the 
                presidents of the synagogue in order that they might pray over them. The 
                prayers of a good man in our behalf have always been regarded as a blessing; no 
                wonder, then, that the mothers of these children desired the prayers of Jesus 
                in behalf of their little ones. It was customary to put the hand upon the 
                person prayed for, probably following the patriarchal precedent (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 48: 14, 15</span></span>). 
                Compare <span class="style7">Acts 6: 6</span></span>):  but {and}  when the disciples saw it, 
            they rebuked them. 




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with 
            indignation, and  called them unto him, saying, {said} unto them,  Suffer the little 
            children to come unto me; forbid them not:  for to such 
            belongeth the kingdom of heaven. {of God.} (<span class="comm">The 
                disciples wished to protect Jesus from what appeared to them to be an unseemly 
                intrusion and annoyance, and possibly, as the context suggests, they thought it 
                was beneath the dignity of the Messiah to turn aside from the affairs of the 
                kingdom of heaven (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 19: 12</span></span>) to 
                pay attention to children. But Jesus was indignant at their officious 
                interference, and directed that the children be brought to him, declaring at 
                the same time that the kingdom of heaven be composed, not of little children, 
                but of such as are childlike in their nature.</span>)   



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 18: 17</span> 
            Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a 
            little child, he shall in no wise enter therein. (<span class="comm">See p. 431.</span>) 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 10: 16</span> And he took them up in his arms,



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 19: 15</span> And he laid {laying}his hands on {upon}  
            them,  and blessed them,  
            and departed thence. (<span class="comm">They were 

                brought that he might lay 
                his hands on them and bless them, and that is what he did for them. The command 
                therefore that they be suffered to come to him should not be perverted into a 
                precept directing that they be brought for other purposes. Those who have 
                construed this as commanding or even permitting either infant baptism or an 
                infant church membership, have abused the text. They are indebted for these 
                ideas, not to the Bible, but to their creeds. The incident told in this section 
                is a fitting sequel to the discourse on divorce. The little children, the 
                offspring of happy wedlock, and a source of constant joy and pleasure to 
                faithful husbands and wives, serve by their presence to correct false 
                impressions as to supposed inconvenience of an indissoluble marriage bond. The 
                sight of them in the arms of Jesus could not fail to leave a good impression 
                with reference to the married life.</span>)
