        <h3>120C. RULERS SEEK TO ENSNARE JESUS.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">COURT OF THE TEMPLE. TUESDAY, APRIL 4, A.D. 30.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>THE GREAT COMMANDMENT.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 22: 34-40; MARK 12: 28-34; LUKE 20: 40.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5"></span> 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 22: 34</span> But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put 
            the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> And one 
            of them, a lawyer,  one of the scribes came, and heard 
            them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well,
            asked him a question, trying him (<span class="comm">he was evidently 
                deputed by those who counseled to ask this question</span>): 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> Teacher, 
            which is the great commandment in the law?  What 
            commandment is the first of all? (<span class="comm">According to the statement of Jewish 
                writers, there had been an old and interminable dispute among the rabbis as to 
                which was the greatest commandment. Some held that it was the law which 
                commanded sacrifices; others, that which commanded the wearing of phylacteries; 
                others contended for those about purification; others, for those about the 
                great feasts. But as they reckoned the commandments of Moses as numbering over 
                six hundred, there was plenty of room for argument. On this memorable day the 
                answers of Jesus had hitherto been of such a nature as to put his questioners 
                to silence. Therefore, in asking this question, they hoped to get an answer 
                about which they could at least find room to wrangle, and thus discredit the 
                wisdom of Jesus.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 29</span> Jesus answered,  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 22: 37</span> And said unto him,  The first is, Hear, O Israel; 
            The Lord our God, the Lord is one: 


            0 And  
            Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and 
            with all thy mind.  and with all thy strength.



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> This is the great and first commandment.
            (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 6: 4-9</span>. This command is 
                first because it is the foundation of the entire law of God. It is greatest, 
                because, in a sense, it includes all the other laws. Polytheism, atheism, 
                idolatry, and all sins against God are forbidden by it. All sins against man 
                are likewise, in 

                a sense, prohibited by it; for sin against man is 
                sin against God's image, and against the objects of God's love. Those who truly 
                love God can not consistently sin against man (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 John 4: 20</span></span>). The curious may make metaphysical distinctions in the 
                analysis of this required fourfold love, but the sum of it is that we are to 
                love God with our whole being.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> And a {<span class="style5">Mark 12: 31</span><span class="style7"> </span>The} 
            second  like unto it
            is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
            thyself. (<span class="comm">Love is the cure for sin, for we can not sin against those whom 
                we truly love. Where we love, we desire to bless. But sin always carries with 
                it a willingness to injure or to curse.</span>) There is none other commandment 
            greater than these.  


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> On these two 
            commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets. (<span class="comm">The generic nature 
                of the law of love is also noted by Paul (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 13: 8-10</span></span>); but love without law is not sufficient. Love 
                begets a desire to bless, but the law guides to the accomplishment of that 
                desire. Perfect righteousness is the result of wisdom as well as affection. 
                Love without law is power without direction, and law without love is machinery 
                without a motor--<span class="style7">1 Corinthians 13: 1-3</span>.</span>)   



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 12: 32</span> And the scribe said unto 
            him, Of a truth, Teacher, thou hast well said that he is one; and there is none 
            other but he: 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> and to love him with all the heart, and with all 
            the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as 
            himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices. (<span class="comm">Here, 
                as in the preceding subdivision, the answer of Jesus was so clearly right that 
                it enforced admiration.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, 
            he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. (<span class="comm">Prejudice is 
                the great obstacle to entering the kingdom. In proportion as we overcome it we 
                draw near to God.</span>) And no man after that durst {<span class="style7">40</span> For they durst not any more} ask him any question. (<span class="comm">They 
                found it expedient to keep silence when their questions only exposed their own 
                shallowness, and made more conspicuous the supreme wisdom of Jesus.</span>)
