        <h3>4. MARY VISITS ELISABETH</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF JUD&AElig;A, B.C. 5.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 1: 39-56 </h3>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> And Mary arose in these days (<span class="comm">within a week or 
                two after the angel appeared to her</span>) and went into the hill country (<span class="comm">the 
                district of Judah lying south of Jerusalem, of which the city of Hebron was the 
                center</span>) with haste (<span class="comm">she fled to those whom God had inspired, so that 
                they could understand her condition and know her innocence--to those who 
                were as Joseph needed to be inspired, that he might understand -- <span class="style7">Matthew 1: 18-25,</span></span>) into a city of 
            Judah (<span class="comm">where Zacharias dwelt--<span class="style7">Luke 1:23</span></span>); </p>
        <p class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> and entered into the house 
            of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth. </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> And it came to pass, when 
            Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1:15</span></span>);
            and Elisabeth was 
            filled with the Holy Spirit (<span class="comm">sufficiently to have a supernatural knowledge 
                of things and to utter prophecy</span>); </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> And she lifted up her voice with 
            a loud cry (<span class="comm">Indicating intense, ecstatic joy. What joy must have filled the 
                hearts of these two women as they realized that one was to be the mother of the 
                long-expected Messiah, and the other of his Elijah-like forerunner!</span>), 
            and said, Blessed (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 1:28</span></span>) 
            art thou among women, and 
            blessed is the fruit of thy 
            womb. </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span> And whence is this to me (<span class="comm">why am I thus 
                honored? -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 8: 7, 8,</span></span>) that the mother of my Lord (<span class="comm">This word imported sometimes divinity, and 
                    sometimes mere superiority. The Jews employed this term in connection with the 
                    Messiah; but in which sense can not now be determined. Inspired writers employ it in the higher sense when applying it to Jesus -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7"> Matthew 22: 41-45, </span></span>) and in that sense it 
                    is no doubt used here</span>) should come unto me? </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> For behold, when 
            the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for 
            joy. </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> And blessed is she 
            that believed (<span class="comm">Elisabeth may have here remembered how her own husband 
                failed to believe</span>); for there shall be a fulfilment of the things 
            which have been spoken to her from the Lord. </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> And Mary said 
            (<span class="comm">She speaks in poetic strain. Her song closely resembles that of 
                Hannah -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7"> 1 Samuel 2: 1-10, </span></span>) My soul doth magnify (<span class="comm">Mary's song is called "The 
                    Magnificat" from this word</span>) the Lord, </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> and my spirit 
            hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> For he hath looked upon the low estate (<span class="comm">this refers to the contrast between her present condition and that of the former glories of David's house, from which she sprang</span>) of his handmaid: For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. (<span class="comm">Here ends the first section of her song. In it she speaks of herself, and her adoration toward God for his condescending blessing. Mary was blessed in her motherhood, Abraham in his covenant and promises, Paul in his apostleship, etc., but none of these human beings are to be worshiped because of the blessings which they received. Rather should we bestow the more worship on God, from whom these their blessings flow -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">James 1: 
                        17.</span></span>) </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span>  For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; And 
            holy is his name. (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 20: 7.</span></span>) </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span> And his mercy is unto generations and generations. (<span class="comm">that is, it is 
                unceasing -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 20: 6 </span></span>) On them that fear him. (<span class="comm">Here ends the second division of her song. In it Mary glorifies God for his power, holiness and mercy.</span>)</p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span> He hath showed strength 
            with his arm. (<span class="comm">"God's efficacy is represented by his finger (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 8: 19</span></span>) his great power by his 
                hand (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 3: 20 </span></span>) and his omnipotence 
                by his arm -- (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 15: 16" </span></span>) ; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.</span>)</p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span> He hath put down princes from their thrones, And hath exalted them of 
            low degree. 
        </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">53</span> The hungry he hath filled with good things; 
            And the rich he hath sent empty away. (<span class="comm">These expressions are hyperboles for 
                the disappointment of the proud, the princely, and the rich, in whose families 
                the Messiah was expected. God has passed these by, and exalted a lowly one. 
                Here ends the third section or verse of the hymn. It speaks of the changes 
                which the Messiah should work as if he had already worked them.</span>) </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">54</span> He hath 
            given help to Israel his servant, That he might remember mercy; </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">55</span> (<span class="comm">As he spake unto our fathers</span>) Toward Abraham (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Micah 7: 20; Galations 3: 16 </span></span>) and his seed for ever. (<span class="comm">The hymn 
                closes with an expression of gratitude to God for his faithfulness in keeping 
                his covenants.</span>) </p><p class="style4"><span class="style5">56</span> And Mary abode with her about three months (<span class="comm">or until 
                John was born</span>), and returned (<span class="comm">a favorite word with Luke, used 
                twenty-one times in his Gospel</span>) unto her house. </p>
