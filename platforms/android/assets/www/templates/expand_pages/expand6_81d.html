        <h3>81D. THIRD WITHDRAWAL FROM HEROD'S TERRITORY.</h3>
        <h3>THE TRANSFIGURATION.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">A SPUR OF HERMON, NEAR C&AElig;SAREA PHILIPPI.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 17: 1-13;  MARK 9: 2-13;  LUKE 9: 28-36.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 28</span> And it came to pass about eight days {six days}  after these sayings (<span class="comm">Mark 
                agrees with Matthew in saying six days. Luke qualifies his estimate by saying 
                "about." But if we regard him as including the day of the 
                "sayings" and also the day of the transfiguration, and the other 
                two as excluding these days, then the three statements tally exactly. The 
                "sayings" referred to were the words of Jesus with regard to his 
                suffering at Jerusalem</span>), that  Jesus taketh 
            {took}  with him Peter, and 
            James, and John his brother (<span class="comm">These three, as leaders among the apostles, 
                needed the special encouragement which was about to be given. For further 
                comment, see page 355</span>), and bringeth them {
            went}  up into a {the}
            high mountain apart by themselves:  
            to pray. (<span class="comm">A tradition dating from the fourth century fixes upon Mt. Tabor 
                as the site of the transfiguration, but this is unquestionably a mistake. Mt. 
                Tabor is in Galilee, while Jesus was still in the region of C&aelig;sarea 
                Philippi (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 9: 30</span></span>). Moreover there 
                is little doubt that at that time and for centuries previous there was an 
                inhabited fortress upon Mt. Tabor (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Josh. 19: 12</span>; Jos. B. J. 1: 8, 7; Vit. 37</span>). Moreover, Mt. Tabor 
                is not a high mountain, its elevation above the sea being but 1,748 feet. 
                Hermon, on the contrary, is the highest mountain in Palestine, its elevation, 
                according to Reclus, being 9,400 feet. It was Jesus' custom to withdraw for 
                prayer by night (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 14: 23, 24; Luke 6: 12; 21: 37; 22: 39</span></span>) and the transfiguration took place at night.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his 
            raiment became white and dazzling.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 17: 2</span> and he was transfigured (<span class="comm">i. e., transformed; the 
                description shows to what extent</span>) before 

            them; and his 
            face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. 
            glistering, exceeding white; so as no fuller on earth 
            can whiten them. (<span class="comm">We may conceive of the body of Jesus becoming luminous 
                and imparting its light to his garments. The Christian looks forward to 
                beholding such a transfiguration and also to participating in 
                it--<span class="style7">1 John 3: 2</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> And, behold, there appeared unto them  
            two men, who were Moses and {with}  
            Elijah;  and they were talking with Jesus. 
            (<span class="comm">The three apostles could identify Moses and Elijah by the course of this 
                conversation, though it is possible that miraculous knowledge may have 
                accompanied miraculous sight.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 31</span> who (<span class="comm">i. 
                e., Moses and Elijah</span>) who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease 
            which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. (<span class="comm">The word for decease is 
                "exodus," an unusual word for death. It means a departure and is, 
                as Bengel says, a very weighty word, since it includes the passion, 
                crucifixion, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Now Peter and 
            they that were with him were heavy with sleep (<span class="comm">it being night</span>); 
            but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood 
            with him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> And it came to pass, as they were departing from 
            him,  Peter answered and 
            said {answereth and saith}  
            unto Jesus,  Rabbi,  Master,
            Lord, it is good for us to be here:  
            and let us make three tabernacles;  if thou wilt, I 
            will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for 
            Elijah.  not knowing what he said.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 9: 6</span> For he knew not what to answer; for they became sore 
            afraid. (<span class="comm">Peter's fears overcame his discretion, but did not silence his 
                tongue. Though he trembled at the fellowship of Moses and Elijah, he also 
                realized the blessedness of it and could not let them depart without an effort 
                to detain them, though the best inducement that he could offer was to build 
                three booths, or arbors, made of the branches of trees, for their and Christ's 
                accommodation. By thus speaking, Peter placed Jesus upon the same level with 
                Moses 

                and Elijah--all three being worthy of a booth.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 34</span> And while he said these things,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 17: 5</span> While he yet speaking, behold,there came  a bright cloudovershadowing them: {and overshadowed 
            them:} and they feared as they entered into the cloud. (<span class="comm">Clouds often roll 
                against the sides of Mt. Hermon, but the brightness of this cloud and the fear 
                which it produced suggests that it was the Shekinah, or cloud of glory, which 
                was the symbol of God's peculiar presence--<span class="style7">Exodus 13: 21-22; 19: 9, 18; 24: 16; 40: 34-35; 1 Kings 8: 10</span>.</span>)   and behold,  there came a 
            voice out of the cloud,  saying, This is my beloved 
            Son,  my chosen:  in whom I am 
            well pleased; hear ye him. (<span class="comm">This command contains the chief significance of 
                the entire scene. Spoken in the presence of Moses and Elijah, it gave Jesus 
                that pre-eminence which a son has over servants. He is to be heard. His words 
                have pre-eminence over those of the lawgiver and the prophet (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Heb. 1: 1-2</span></span>). Peter recognized Jesus as thus 
                honored by this voice--<span class="style7">2 Peter 1: 16-18</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 17: 6</span> And when the disciples heard it, they fell on 
            their face, and were sore afraid. (<span class="comm">As every man is who hears the voice of 
                God.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not 
            afraid. (<span class="comm">As mediator between man and God, Jesus removes fear.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 9: 8</span> And suddenly looking round about,
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 17: 8</span> And lifting up their eyes,  they saw no 
            one any more, save Jesus only with themselves.  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 9: 36</span> And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. (<span class="comm">Leaders and 
                prophets depart, but Christ abides--<span class="style7">Hebrews 3: 5-6</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 9: 9</span> And as they were coming down 
            from the mountain, he charged them, that they should tell no man what things 
            they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the 
            dead.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> And they kept the saying, 

            questioning among themselves what the rising from the dead should mean. 
            (<span class="comm">Jesus spake so often in parables and made so frequent use of metaphors that 
                the apostles did not take his words concerning the resurrection in a literal 
                sense. They regarded his language as figurative, and sought to interpret the 
                figure.</span>)   And they held their peace, and told no man in 
            those days any of the things which they had seen.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 17: 9</span> And Jesus commanded them, 
            saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen from the 
            dead. (<span class="comm">The people were not ready for the publication of such an event. To 
                have told it now would only have been to raise doubts as to their veracity.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say 
            the scribes that Elijah must first come?   How is it that the scribes say that Elijah 
            must first come? (<span class="comm">They were puzzled by the disappearance of Elijah. They 
                looked upon him as having come to fulfill the prophecy of Malachi (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Malachi 4: 5-6</span></span>), but they marveled that, having 
                come, he should so soon withdraw, and that they should be forbidden to tell 
                that they had seen him, since the sight of him would be some sign of Jesus' 
                Messiahship.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And he answered andsaid unto them, Elijah indeed cometh first, and restoreth {
            shall restore} all things (<span class="comm">this sentence leads some to 
                think that Elijah will appear again before the second coming of our Lord, but 
                the words are to be interpreted in connection with the rest of the passage</span>)
            :  and how it is written of the Son of man, that he 
            should suffer many things, and be set at naught? (<span class="comm">If the writings 
                concerning Elijah perplexed the apostles, those concerning the Messiah 
                perplexed them also. From one set of prophecies they might learn something 
                about the other. Elijah came, but the Scriptures concerning him were so little 
                understood that he was put to death. The Messiah also came, and the prophecies 
                concerning him were so little understood that he, too, would be set at naught.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 9: 13</span> But I say unto you, that Elijah is come,  
            already, and they knew him not, but did {and they 
            have also done} unto him whatsoever they would. Even as it is written of 
            him.  Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of 
            them.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 17: 13</span> Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of 
            John the Baptist. (<span class="comm">Malachi used the name of Elijah figuratively to 
                represent John the Baptist. See pp. 102, 284. That there shall be 
                a second coming of Elijah in fulfillment of this prophecy is hardly possible, 
                for the office of Elijah is prophetically outlined as that of the restorer. But 
                Elijah could not restore Judaism, for that dispensation had been done away with 
                in Christ. He could hardly have chosen to restore Christianity, for even if it 
                should need such a restoration, a Jewish prophet would be ill-suited to such an 
                office. One of the apostles would be vastly preferable.</span>)
