        <h3>95. PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY JUD&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 10: 25-37.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made 
            trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
            (<span class="comm">For the term lawyer see pp. 313, 314, The lawyer wished to make trial of the 
                skill of Jesus in solving the intricate and difficult question as to how to 
                obtain salvation. Jesus was probably teaching in some house or courtyard, and 
                his habit of giving local color to his parables suggests that he was probably 
                in or near Bethany, through which the road from Jerusalem to Jericho passes. 
                The lawyer stood up to attract attention to himself, and thus give emphasis to 
                his question and its answer.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> And he said unto him, What is written in 
            the law? how readest thou? (<span class="comm">Looking upon Jesus as a sabbath-breaker and a 
                despiser of tradition, the lawyer no doubt expected that Jesus would lay down 
                some new rule for obtaining salvation. If so, he was surprised to be thus 
                referred to the law of Moses for his answer.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> And he answering said, Thou 
            shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with 
            all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. 
            (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Deuteronomy 6: 4-5; Leviticus 19: 18</span>. Having 
                made himself conspicuous by standing up, the lawyer had to give the best answer 
                he knew or sully his own reputation for knowledge. He therefore gives the two 
                great laws which comprise all other laws.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> And he said unto him, Thou 
            hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. (<span class="comm">The lawyer had asked 
                his question simply as a test. With him the law was simply matter for 
                speculation and theory, and the word "do" was very startling. It 
                showed the difference between his and the Master's views of the law. He had 
                hoped by a question to expose Jesus as one who set aside the law, but 

                Jesus had exposed the lawyer as one who merely theorized about the 
                law, and himself as one who advocated the doing of the law.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> But he, 
            desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor? (<span class="comm">He 
                could justify his conduct if permitted to define the word 
                "neighbor." He asked his question, therefore, in the expectation of 
                securing such a definition of the word as would enable him to maintain his 
                public standing and quiet his conscience.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> Jesus made answer and said, A 
            certain man (<span class="comm">evidently a Jew, for otherwise the nationality would have been 
                specified</span>) was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among 
            robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half 
            dead. (<span class="comm">The road from Jerusalem to Jericho is eighteen miles long, and 
                descends about 3,500 feet. About two miles from Jerusalem it passes through the 
                village of Bethany, and for the rest of the eighteen miles it passes through 
                desolate mountain ravines without any habitation save the inn, the ruins of 
                which are still seen about half way to Jericho. This district from that time 
                till the present has been noted for robberies, and Jerome tells that the road 
                was called the "bloody way."</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> And by chance a certain priest 
            was going down that way (<span class="comm">a very natural thing for a priest to do, for there 
                was a very large priestly settlement at Jericho</span>): and when he saw 
            him, he passed by on the other side. (<span class="comm">He did this although the law 
                commanded mercy and help to a neighbor--<span class="style7">Exodus 23: 4; Deuteronomy 22: 1-4</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> And in like manner a Levite 
            also (<span class="comm">A temple minister. The tribe of Levi had been set apart by God for 
                his service</span>), when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on 
            the other side. (<span class="comm">In the priest and Levite the lawyer saw the picture of his 
                own life, for he saw in them those who knew the law, but did not practice it. 
                There may have been many excuses for this neglect of the wounded man: danger, 
                hate, dread of defilement, expense, but Jesus does not consider any of them 
                worth mentioning.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> But a certain Samaritan (<span class="comm">the hereditary enemy of 
                the Jew--<span class="style7">John 4: 9</span></span>), as 
            he journeyed, came 

            where he was: and when he saw him, he 
            was moved with compassion,
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> and came to him, and bound up his 
            wounds, pouring on them oil and 
            wine (<span class="comm">the ordinary remedies for wounds--<span class="style7">Isaiah 1: 6</span></span>); and he set him on his own beast, and brought 
            him to an inn, and took care of him.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> And on the morrow he took 
            out two shillings (<span class="comm">the shilling or denarius was worth about seventeen 
                cents, but it represented the price of a day's labor</span>), and gave them 
            to the host (<span class="comm">the inn-keeper</span>), and said, Take care of him; and 
            whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee. 
            (<span class="comm">The compassion of the Samaritan bore full fruitage. However heterodox he was, 
                he was after all a worshiper of Jehovah and more orthodox at heart than either 
                the priest or the Levite. Though it was not customary for an inn-keeper to 
                furnish food either for man or beast, he could do so if he chose out of his own 
                stores. The scant cash left by the Samaritan indicates a poverty which made his 
                charity the more praiseworthy. His eye and heart and hand and foot and purse 
                were all subservient to the law of God.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> Which of these three, thinkest 
            thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers? (<span class="comm">Instead of 
                answering didactically, "Everybody is your neighbor," Jesus had 
                incarnated the law of neighborliness in the good Samaritan, and had made it so 
                beautiful that the lawyer could not but commend it even when found in a 
                representative of this apostate race. He showed, too, that the law was not for 
                causistry but for practice.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And he said, He that showed mercy on him.
            (<span class="comm">The lawyer avoided the name Samaritan so distasteful to his lips. Jesus gave 
                countenance to no such racial prejudice, even though the Samaritans had 
                rejected him but a few weeks before this--<span class="style7">Luke 9: 53</span>.</span>) Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. 
            (<span class="comm">All the laws and teachings of God are to be generously interpreted (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 5: 43-44</span></span>) and are to be embodied in the 
                life--<span class="style7">Matthew 7: 24-27</span>.</span>)
