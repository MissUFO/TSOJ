        <h3>66. JESUS STILLS THE STORM.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">SEA OF GALILEE;</span></h3>
        <h3>SAME DAY AS LAST SECTION</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 8: 18-27; MARK 4: 35-41; LUKE 8: 22-25.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 35</span> And that day, {one 
            of those days,}  when the even was come (<span class="comm">about 
                sunset</span>),  when Jesus saw great multitudes about 
            him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side. {he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.} (<span class="comm">Wearied with a 
                day of strenuous toil, Jesus sought rest from the multitude by passing to the 
                thinly settled on the east side of Galilee.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 19</span> 
            And there came a scribe (<span class="comm">Literally, one scribe. The number is emphatic; 
                for, so far as the record shows, Jesus had none of this class among his 
                disciples</span>), and said unto him, Teacher, I will follow thee 
            whithersoever thou goest. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes (<span class="comm">caves, dens</span>), and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man (<span class="comm">Daniel's name for the Messiah--<span class="style7">Daniel 7: 10-13</span></span>) hath not where to lay his head. (<span class="comm">This 
                scribe had heard the wonderful parables concerning the kingdom. He, like all 
                others, expected an earthly kingdom and sought to have a place in it. Jesus so 
                replied as to correct his false expectations.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. (<span class="comm">This disciple must have been one of the twelve, for these only were required to follow Jesus</span> (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Mark 3: 14</span></span>). It may 
            have been James or John, whose father, Zebedee, almost certainly died before 
            Jesus did. He may have just heard of his father's death. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> But Jesus saith unto him, Follow me; 
            and leave the dead to bury their own dead. (<span class="comm">Let the spiritually dead bury 
                the naturally dead. This was a very exceptional prohibition, intended to show 
                not that it was ordinarily wrong to stop for burying the dead, but wrong when 
                in conflict with a command from Jesus. God bids us recognize the claims of 
                filial duty, but rightfully insists that our duties toward him are superior to 
                those due our parents.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> Now it came to pass 
            that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> And when he was entered into a boat, his disciples 
            followed him.  and he said unto them, Let us go over 
            unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 36</span> And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even 
            as he was, in the boat. (<span class="comm">They took Jesus without any preparation for the 
                journey. The crowd, doubtless, made it inconvenient to go ashore to get 
                provisions.</span>) And other boats were with him. (<span class="comm">The owners of these boats 
                had probably been using them to get near to Jesus as he preached. They are 
                probably mentioned to show that a large number witnessed the miracle when Jesus 
                stilled the tempest.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 23</span> But as they sailed he 
            fell asleep. (<span class="comm">knowing his labors during the day, we can not wonder at 
                this</span>):  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 37</span>  And there ariseth  and there came down  a great storm of 
            wind,  on the lake;  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 24</span>  And, behold, 

            there arose a great tempest in the sea, 
            insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves:  and 
            the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.
            and they were filling with 
            water, and were in jeopardy. (<span class="comm">These storms come with great 
                suddenness. See McGarvey's "Lands of the Bible," page 519.</span>) 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 38</span>  And {but}  
            he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion (<span class="comm">The cushion was 
                the seat-cover, which, as Smith remarks, was probably "a sheepskin with 
                the fleece, which, when rolled up, served as a pillow." The stern was the 
                most commodious place for passengers. The tossing ship has been accepted in all 
                ages as a type of the church in seasons of peril</span>):  

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 25</span>  And they came to him, and awoke him, {they 
            awake him,} and say unto him, {saying,} Save, Lord; 
            we perish.  Master, master, we perish.Teacher, carest thou not that we perish? (<span class="comm">There was a babble 
                of confused voices, betraying the extreme agitation of the disciples.</span>) 


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 39</span>  
            And he awoke,  Then he arose, and rebuked the winds, 
            {wind,}  and the sea;
            and the raging of the water;  and 
            said unto the sea, Peace, be still.  and they 
            ceased,  And the wind ceased, and there was a great 
            calm. (<span class="comm">In addressing the winds and waves Jesus personified them to give 
                emphasis to his authority over them. The calm showed the perfection of the 
                miracle, for the waves of such a lake continue to roll long after the winds 
                have ceased.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 8: 25</span>  And he said unto them, Where is 
            your faith?  Why are ye yet fearful? have ye not yet 
            faith?  O ye of little faith? (<span class="comm">They had little 
                faith or they would not have been so frightened; but they had some faith, else 
                they would not have appealed to Jesus.</span>)   


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 4: 41</span>  And 
            they feared exceedingly,  And being afraid they
            the men marvelled,  and said one to 
            another,  saying one to another,  
            What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?
            Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds, and the 
            water, and they obey him? (<span class="comm">Jesus' complete lordship over the realm of 
                nature made his disciples very certain of his divinity.</span>)
