            there ran
            {came}
            one
            a certain ruler
            to him, and kneeled to him, and asked
            and said,
            {saying,}
            Good Teacher,
            what good thing shall I do, that I may have
            {may inherit
            to inherit} eternal life?

            (<span class="comm">The action of this young man in running and kneeling 
                shows that he was deeply anxious to receive an answer to his 
                question, and also that he had great reverence for Jesus. He 
                seemed to think, however, that heaven could be gained by 
                performing some one meritorious act. He made the mistake 
                of thinking that eternal life is a reward for doing rather than 
                for being, a mistake from which the Roman Catholic Church 


                developed the doctrine of "works of supererogation."</span>)

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 18: 19</span> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good save one, even God: Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good (<span class="comm">To the address of the young man, viz.: &quot;Good Master,&quot; Jesus replies, &quot;Why callest,&quot; etc., and to his question, &quot;What good thing,&quot; etc. Jesus replies, &quot;Why askest,&quot; etc. The ruler using the inconsiderate, conventional language of the thoughtless, had taken an unwarrantable freedom with the word &quot;good.&quot; Jesus shows that if his language had been used sincerely it would have committed him to a declaration of great faith, for he had addressed Jesus by a title which belongs only to God, and he had asked Jesus the question concerning that of which God alone was fitted to speak. As the ruler had not used this language sincerely Jesus challenged his words. The challenge showed the ruler that he had unwittingly confessed the divinity of Jesus, and thus startled him into a consideration of the marvelous fact which his own mouth had stated. This is done because the young man would need to believe in the divinity of Jesus to endure the test to which he was about to be subjected--<span class="style7">1 John 5: 5</span>

                but if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments. 

                (<span class="comm">By referring the ruler to the commandments, 
                    Jesus not only answered the question as to obtaining life, but 
                    he emphasized the confession of his divinity contained in the 
                    question, "Why askest," etc. God, who knows what is good, 
                    had revealed that good in the commandments which he had 
                    given. Yet the ruler had asked Jesus to be wise above God's
                    revelation, and to propound a law or rule of goodness in addition 
                    to that already given, and of such a nature as to more fully 
                    insure the attainment of life by obeying it. The ruler's question 
                    reveals that common weakness in man which prompts him 
                    to look to his fellow-men for religious and moral instruction; 
                    forgetting that only God can propound the absolute standards 
                    of goodness. We should note, too, that the young man, being 
                    under the law given through Moses, was bidden to attain life 
                    by keeping the law. After the death of Christ a new law  


                    was given. Had the man waited until that time, he would have
                    been directed to this new law, and obedience to it would 
                    have been required. Compare

            (<span class="comm">The ruler still sought for
                some prominent commandment, but was referred to the
                last six of the Decalogue, these being at that time more
                frequently violated than the first four. For the last commandment,
                "Thou shalt not covet," Jesus substitutes its
                equivalent, "Do not defraud," and "Thou shalt love thy
                neighbor as thyself," the last being a summary of all the
                six-- <span class="style7">Romans 13: 9.</span></span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 10: 21</span> And Jesus when he heard it, looking upon him (<span class="comm">gazing earnestly and searchingly at him</span>) loved him (<span class="comm">&quot;agapan.&quot; See p. 519</span>), and said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet (<span class="comm">a direct answer to the direct question, &quot;What lack,&quot; etc.</span>) If thou wouldest be perfect (<span class="comm">i. e., in keeping the commandments and in securing eternal life--<span class="style7">James 2: 10</span> go, sell that which thou hast, sell all whatsoever thou hast, and distribute {give} unto {to} the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. (<span class="comm">The command to sell all is not a general one, but a special precept needed in this case, 1. To dispel the ruler's self-deception. On the negative side his character was good, but on the positive it was deficient. He had done his neighbor no harm, but he had also done him very little good. 2. To show impartiality. The invitation of Jesus shows that the ruler desired to be in some manner a disciple, and hence he is subjected to the same test which the other disciples had accepted, and of which Peter soon after speaks. Paul also was rich in self-righteousness like this man, but cheerfully sacrificed all, that he might follow Christ (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Phillipians 3: 6-9</span></span>). 
                    Moreover, the reference to treasure
                    in heaven and the invitation to follow Christ tested the ruler's
                    obedience to the first four commandments of the Decalogue 
                    as condensed in the great summary or first commandment.
                    (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 22: 37,38</span></span>) Though the ruler perhaps did not fully realize it, those who heard the conversation must afterwards have been impressed with the great truth that the ruler was called upon to make his choice whether he would love Christ or the world, whether he would serve God or mammon. The whole scene forms an illustration of the doctrine expressed by Paul, that by the law can no flesh be justified (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 3: 20</span></span>),
                    for
                    perfection is required of those who approach God along that pathway;
                    those, therefore, who have done all, still need Christ to lead 
                    them.</span>)

            {these things}
            his countenance fell at the saying,
            he became exceeding sorrowful;
            and he went away sorrowful: 
            for he was very rich.
            he was one that had great possessions.

            (<span class="comm">He was not offended at the extravagance 
                of Jesus' demands, for he was not one of the most 
                hardened of the rich. He belonged to that class which hold 
                Christ and their wealth in nearly an even balance. The
                narrative shows us how uncompromisingly Jesus held to principle.
                Though the ruler was sorry to turn away, and though 
                Jesus loved him, yet the Lord did not modify his demand by a 
                hair's-breadth to gain an influential disciple.</span>)

            riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

            (<span class="comm">The needle's eye here is 
                that of the literal needle, and the expression was a proverbial 
                one to indicate that which was absolutely impossible. Lord 
                George Nugent (<span class="comm">1845-6</span>) introduced the explanation that Jesus
                referred to the two gates of a city, the large one for beast of 
                burden, and the small one for foot-passengers. This smaller
                one is now called "The Needle's Eye," but there is no evidence
                whatever that it was so called in our Saviour's time. In fact, 
                as Canon Farrar observes, we have every reason to believe that 
                this smaller gate received its name in late years because of the 
                efforts of those who were endeavoring to soften this saying 
                of Jesus.</span>)

            possible with God.
            The things which are impossible with men aree possible with 
            God.

            (<span class="comm">The Jews were accustomed to 
                look upon the possession of riches as an evidence of divine 
                favor, and the heads of the apostles were filled with visions of 
                the riches and honors which they would enjoy when Jesus set 
                up his kingdom. No wonder, then, that they were amazed to
                find that it was impossible for a rich man to enter that kingdom, 
                and that, moreover and worse than all, riches appeared 
                to exclude from salvation itself: that even this virtuous rich 
                man, this paragon of excellence, could not have eternal life 
                because he clung to his riches. But they were comforted by 
                the assurance of Jesus that though the salvation of some men 
                might present more difficulties than the salvation of others  


                --might, as it were, require a miracle where others only 
                required simple means, yet the gracious, mighty God might
                still be trusted to overcome the obstacles. It is impossible for 
                any man to save himself, so that in every case of salvation God 
                is called upon to assist man in accomplishing the impossible. 
                God can so work upon the rich man's heart as to make him a 
                dispenser of blessings.</span>)

                though perhaps none of them could have been said to 
                have held great possessions. The mention of treasure in 
                heaven, therefore, set Peter to wondering what manner of
                return would be made to them to compensate them for their

            sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,

            (<span class="comm">By the 
                term "regeneration," Jesus in this case means the period in
                which the process of regenerating men would be in progress;
                i. e., the period of the mediatorial reign. After his ascension
                Jesus sat upon his throne
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 2: 33-35;  Hebrews 1: 13; Matthew 25: 31; 1 Corinthians 15: 24-28</span></span>).
                And on the day of Pentecost
                next following, he began this process of regeneration. Having
                enthroned himself, Jesus enthroned the apostles also, not as
                kings but as judges, having jurisdiction over all questions of
                faith and practice in the earthly kingdom. During their personal
                ministry, they judged in person; and since then they 
                judge through their writings. True, we have written communications
                from only a part of them, but judgments pronounced 
                by one of a bench of judges with the known approval 
                of all, are the judgments of the entire bench. Moreover, the 
                passage must be construed metaphorically, for the apostles are  


                judges in the church of Christ--the true Israel--and not over 
                the literal twelve tribes of Jacob. And again, the twelve who 
                then heard Jesus speak were not all enthroned, Judas having 
                fallen from his position before the day of enthronement, and
                Matthias and Paul were afterwards added to the group. Jesus
                here causes the number of the judges to correspond to the 
                number of the tribes, to indicate that there will be a sufficiency 
                of judgment commensurate to the need.</span>)

            (<span class="comm">The meaning of this 
                parable has often been misunderstood by those who fail to note 
                the maxim with which Jesus begins and ends it. This maxim
                acts as a safeguard in the interpretation of it; the parable 
                also in turn guards against misunderstanding the maxim. The 
                maxim can not be applied to Judas; for, though he then stood 
                high in honor and afterwards fell into disgrace, yet he stands 
                outside the pale of the maxim as interpreted by the parable, 
                for in the parable both the first and the last were received and 
                rewarded by their master, while Judas was rejected of Christ 
                and received no reward. The term "last," therefore, must be 
                applied to those who were included among the accepted 
                laborers, and not those who were excluded from that class.
                In the parable, the denarius or shilling stands for the gift of 


                eternal life. The vineyard represents the Lord's field of work 
                in the world. The evening is the close of the Christian dispensation, 
                and the coming of Christ to judgment. The parable as 
                it unfolds and develops suggests that in no case was the reward 
                earned by the inherent merits and toil of the laborers, but was 
                rather bestowed because of a desire on the part of the householder 
                to that effect, just as eternal life is bestowed, not by
                merit, but by covenant grace 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 2: 6, 7; 4: 3-5; 5: 16-21</span></span>).
                The main object of the parable is to show that longer labor 
                does not necessarily, as the apostles and others might think, 
                establish a claim to higher reward. Degrees of difference 
                there no doubt will be, but they form no account in the general 
                covenant of grace in which the one great gift is offered to us 
                all. As the gift can be no less than eternal life, there must of 
                necessity be a difference in the ratio of service which is rendered 
                for it, since it will be bestowed on the octogenarian and 
                the child, upon Paul who made good the confession of his faith 
                through years of toil, and the dying thief who passed to his
                reward while his voice of confession was, as it were, still 
                ringing in the ears of those who heard it 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">1 Corinthians 15: 8-11; 2 Timothy 4: 6-9</span></span>).
                The murmuring and envy of those who had 
                labored longest is merely part of the parabolic drapery, introduced 
                to bring out the answer of the householder, and to make 
                plain the point to be illustrated. There will be no envy among 
                those who inherit eternal life. By thus speaking of the envy, 
                however, and showing how ineffectual it was, Jesus warns us
                to be prepared not to cherish it. The parable is not intended 
                to teach that the characters of men will be exactly similar in 
                the world to come. Paul will not be Peter, nor will Martin 
                Luther be identical with Hugh Latimer and John Knox. God 
                may award eternal life to the character which we are forming, 
                but we should be careful what kind of character we bring to 
                receive the gift.  The lesson is that works are valued qualitatively 
                and not quantitatively. Nor may the parable be rightly 
                used to encourage hope in death-bed repentance. It certainly 
                does teach that, however little the labor which a man does in 
                the Lord's vineyard, he will receive the final reward if only he  


                be really in the vineyard; that is, if he be really a child of God. 
                But whether a man who repents on his death-bed actually becomes 
                a child of God is a different question, and is not 
                touched by the parable. Certainly the eleventh-hour laborer 
                who had stood idle all day only because no man had hired 
                him, and who came into the vineyard as soon as he was called, 
                can not represent the man who has been called by the gospel
                every hour of his life, but has rejected every call until his sun 
                has sunk so low that he knows he can do but little work when 
                he comes. In order to represent this class of sinners, the 
                eleventh-hour men should have been invited early in the 
                morning, and should have replied, "No, it is too early; we will 
                not go now."  Then they should have been invited at the third, 
                the sixth, and the ninth hours, and should have made some 
                equally frivolous excuse each time, then, finally, at the eleventh 
                hour, they should have said, "Well, as you pay a man just the
                same for an hour's work as for a day's work, and as we are 
                very anxious to get your money, we believe we will now go." 
                Had they acted thus, it is not likely that they would have 
                found the vineyard gates open to them at all. Yet such is the 
                sharp practice which some men attempt in dealing with God.</span>)
