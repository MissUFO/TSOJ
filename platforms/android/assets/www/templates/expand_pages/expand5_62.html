        <h3>62. JESUS DENOUNCES PHARISEES.</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 11: 37-54.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span>  Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with 
            him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. (<span class="comm">The repast to which Jesus was 
                invited was a morning meal, usually eaten between ten and eleven o'clock. The 
                principal meal of the day was eaten in the evening. Jesus dined with all 
                classes, with publicans and Pharisees, with friends and enemies.</span>)   
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span>   And 
            when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself 
            before dinner. (<span class="comm">The Pharisee marveled at this because the tradition of the 
                elders required them to wash their hands before eating, and, if they had been 
                in a crowd where their bodies might have been touched by some unclean person, 
                they washed their whole bodies. It was a custom which ministered to pride and 
                self-righteousness.</span>)    
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span>   The Lord said to him (<span class="comm">Our Lord's speech is 
                unsparingly denunciatory. To some it seems strange that Jesus spoke thus in a 
                house where he was an invited guest. But our Lord never suspended the solemn 
                work of reproof out of mere compliment. He was governed by higher laws than 
                those of conventional politeness</span>), Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the 
            outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion 
            and wickedness.    
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span>  Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the 
            outside make the inside also? (<span class="comm">Since God made both the inner and the outer, 
                a true reverence for him requires that both parts be alike kept clean.</span>) 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span>  But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are 
            clean unto you. (<span class="comm">That is, give your inner life, your love, mercy, 
                compassion, etc., to the blessing of mankind, and then your inner purity will 
                make you proof 

                against outward defilement--<span class="style7">Matthew 15: 11; Titus 1: 15; Romans 14: 4</span>.</span>) 

        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span>   But 
            woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass 
            over justice and the love of God: but these ought ye to have done, and not to 
            leave the other undone. (<span class="comm">The Pharisees in paying the tenth part, or tithe, 
                to God, were so exact that they offered the tenth part of the seed even of the 
                spearmint, rue and other small garden herbs, and many contended that the very 
                stalks of these plants should also be tithed. Jesus commends this care about 
                little things, but nevertheless rebukes the Pharisees because they were as 
                careless about big things, such as justice, and the love of God, as they were 
                careful about herb seed. Rue was a small shrub about two feet high, and is said 
                to have been used to flavor wine, and for medicinal purposes.</span>)  
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span>  Woe unto 
            you, Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the 
            salutations in the marketplaces. (<span class="comm">They were vainglorious, loving the honors 
                and attentions given by men (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 5: 44 </span></span>). They loved on week days to be saluted in the marketplace, and on the Sabbath 
                to sit in the semi-circular row of seats which were back of the lectern, or 
                desk of the reader, and which faced the congregation.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span>   Woe unto you! for 
            ye are as the tombs which appear not, and the men that walk over them know it not. (<span class="comm">According to the 
                Mosaic law, any one who touched a grave was rendered unclean (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Numbers 19: 16 </span></span>). That they might not touch graves 
                and be made unclean without knowing it, the Jews white-washed their graves and 
                tombs once a year. But Jesus likens a Pharisee to graves which defiled men 
                unawares. Their hypocrisy concealed their true nature, so that men were injured 
                and corrupted by their influence without being aware of it. Jesus pronounces 
                three woes upon the Pharisees for three sins, viz.: 1. Hypocrisy, shown in 
                pretending to be be very careful when they were really extremely careless; 2. 
                Vainglory; 3. Corruption of the public morals.</span>)   
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span>  And one of the lawyers 
            answering saith unto him, Teacher, in saying this thou reproachest us also. 
            (<span class="comm">Lightfoot supposes that a 

                scribe was one who copied the law of 
                Moses, while a lawyer expounded the oral law or traditions of the elders. But 
                it is more likely that the terms were used interchangeably. They leaned to the 
                Pharisee party, and hence this one felt the rebuke which Jesus addressed to 
                that party. The scribe intimated that Jesus had spoken hastily, and his speech 
                is a suggestion to Jesus to correct or modify his unguarded words. But Jesus 
                made no mistakes and spoke no hasty words.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span>  And he said, Woe unto you 
            lawyers also! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye 
            yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. (<span class="comm">We have seen in 
                the traditions with regard to the Sabbath how these Jewish lawyers multiplied 
                the burdens which Moses had placed upon the people. They were careful to lay 
                these burdens upon others, but equally careful not to bear them 
                themselves--no, not even to keep the law of Moses itself--<span class="style7">Matthew 23: 2, 3.</span></span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span>  Woe unto you! for ye 
            build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span>   So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed 
            them, and ye build their tombs. 
            (<span class="comm">Tombs were usually dug in the rock in the sides of hills or cliffs. To build 
                them therefore was to decorate or ornament the entrance. Though their act in 
                building the sepulchres was a seeming honor to the prophets, God did not accept 
                it as such. A prophet is only truly honored when his message is received and 
                obeyed. The lawyers were not in fellowship with the prophets, but with those 
                who murdered the prophets: hence the Saviour pictures the whole transaction 
                from the killing of the prophets to the building of their sepulchres as one 
                act in which all concurred, and all of which were guilty. Abbott gives the 
                words a figurative meaning, thus: your fathers slew the prophets by violence, 
                and you bury them by false teaching.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span>   Therefore also said the wisdom of 
            God, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and some of them they shall kill and 
            persecute; 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span>  that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed 
            from the foundation of the world, may be required of this 

            generation (<span class="comm">The phrase "wisdom of God" has been very puzzling, 
                for the words spoken by Jesus are not found in any Old Testament book. Among 
                the explanations the best is that which represents Jesus as quoting the trend 
                or tenor of several prophecies such as <span class="style7">2 Chronicles 24: 19-22; 36: 14-16; Proverbs 1: 20-33 </span>. 
                It may, however, be possible that Jesus is here publishing a new decree or 
                conclusion of God, for the words specifically concerned the present generation. 
                If so, Jesus assents to the decree of the Father by calling it "the 
                wisdom of God," and the language is kindred to that at <span class="style7">Matthew 11: 25, 26</span></span>); 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span>  From the blood of 
            Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the 
            sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation. 
            (<span class="comm">Abel is accounted a prophet because his form of sacrifice prefigured that of 
                Christ. His murder is described at <span class="style7">Genesis 4: 1-8 </span>, the first historical book of the Bible, while that of 
                Zachariah is described at <span class="style7">2 Chronicles 24: 20-22 </span>, in the last historical book of the Old Testament. From 
                the record of one, therefore, to the record of the other embraces the entire 
                catalogue of the Old Testament martyrs. Tradition assigns one of the four great 
                sepulchral monuments at the foot of Olivet to Zachariah. That generation 
                sanctioned all the sins of the past and went beyond them to the crucifixion of 
                the Son of God. The best comment on this passage is the parable at <span class="style7">Luke 20: 9-16. </span> God made that generation 
                the focus of the world's light and privilege, but the men of that time made it 
                the focus of the world's wickedness and punishment. The punishment began about 
                thirty-seven years later in the war with Rome, which lasted five years and 
                culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem.</span>) 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span>   Woe unto you lawyers! for ye 
            took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that 
            were entering in ye hindered. (<span class="comm">A true knowledge of the Scriptures was a key 
                which opened the door to the glories of Christ and his kingdom. This the lawyer 
                had given away by teaching not the contents of the book, but the rubbish and 
                trifles of tradition. They did not open the door for themselves, and by their 


                pretentious interference they confused others in their efforts to 
                open it.</span>) 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">53</span>   And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the 
            Pharisees began to press upon him 
            vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things; 

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">54</span>  laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth. (<span class="comm">They plied him 
                with many questions, hoping that they could irritate him into making a hot or 
                hasty answer. For methods used to entrap Jesus see <span class="style7">Matthew 22:15-17.</span></span>)
