        <h3>33. PREACHING TOUR THROUGH GALILEE.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 4: 23-25;  MARK 1: 35-39;  LUKE 4: 42-44.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 35</span>     And in the morning, a great while before day, he 
            rose up went out (<span class="comm">i. e., from the house of Simon Peter</span>), 
            and departed into a desert place, and there prayed. (<span class="comm">Though Palestine was 
                densely populated, its people were all gathered into towns, so that it was 
                usually easy to find solitude outside the city limits. A ravine near Capernaum, 
                called the Vale of Doves, would afford such solitude. Jesus taught (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 6: 6</span></span>) and practiced solitary prayer. We can 
                commune with God better when alone than when in the company of even our dearest 
                friends. It is a mistaken notion that one can pray equally well at all times 
                and in all places. Jesus being in all things like men, except that he was 
                sinless (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hebrews 2: 17</span></span>), must have found 
                prayer a real necessity. He prayed as a human being. Several reasons for this 
                season of prayer are suggested, from which we select two: 1. It was a safeguard 
                against the temptation to vainglory induced by the unbounded admiration and 
                praise of the multitude whom he had just healed. 2. It was a fitting 
                preparation on the eve of his departure on his first missionary tour.</span>) 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 42</span>    And when it was day, he came out and went into a 
            desert place. (<span class="comm">Mark has in mind the season when Jesus sought the Father in 
                prayer, and so he tells us it was "a great while before day." Luke 
                has in mind the hour when Jesus faced and spoke to the multitude, so he says, 
                "When it was day."</span>)   </p>




        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 36</span>  And Simon. 
            (<span class="comm">As head of the house which Jesus had just left, Simon naturally acted as 
                leader and guide to the party which sought Jesus</span>) and they that were with 
            him (<span class="comm">they who were stopping in Simon's house; viz.: Andrew, James, and 
                John</span>) followed after him 

            (<span class="comm">literally, "pursued after 
                him." Xenophon uses this word to signify the close pursuit of an enemy in 
                war. Simon had no hesitancy in obtruding on the retirement of the Master. This 
                rushing after Jesus in hot haste accorded with his impulsive nature. The 
                excited interest of the people seemed to the disciples of Jesus to offer golden 
                opportunities, and they could not comprehend his apparent indifference to it</span>)
            ;   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span>  and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee. 
            (<span class="comm">The disciples saw a multitude seeking Jesus for various causes: some to hear, 
                some for excitement, some for curiosity. To satisfy the people seemed to them 
                to be Christ's first duty. Jesus understood his work better than they. He never 
                encouraged those who sought through mere curiosity or admiration (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 6: 27</span></span>). Capernaum accepted the benefit of 
                his miracles, but rejected his call to repentance--<span class="style7">Matthew 11: 23.</span></span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span>   And he saith unto them, Let us go 
            elsewhere into the next towns (<span class="comm">the other villages of Galilee</span>), 
            that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth. (<span class="comm">i. e., 
                I came forth from the Father (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 16: 28</span></span>) to make and preach a gospel. His disciples failed to understand 
                his mission. Afterwards preaching was with the apostles the all-important 
                duty--<span class="style7">Acts 6: 2; 1 Corinthians 1: 17.</span></span>) and the multitudes sought him after him, and came unto him, 
            and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them. (<span class="comm">They would 
                have selfishly kept his blessed ministries for their own exclusive enjoyment.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Luke 4: 43</span>   But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of 
            God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent. (<span class="comm">Jesus sought to 
                arouse the entire nation. That which the disciples regarded as a large work in 
                Capernaum was consequently in his sight a very small one. Those who understand 
                that it is God's will and wish to save every man that lives upon the earth will 
                not be overelated by a successful revival in some small corner of the great 
                field of labor.</span>)   
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Mark 1: 39</span>  And he  
            Jesus went about in all Gailiee (<span class="comm">The extreme length of Galilee was about 
                sixty-three miles, and its extreme width about thirty-three miles. Its average 


                dimensions were about fifty by twenty-five miles. It contained, 
                according to Josephus, two hundred and forty towns and villages. Its population 
                at that time is estimated at about three millions. Lewin calculates that this 
                circuit of Galilee must have occupied four or five months. The verses of this 
                paragraph are, therefore, a summary of the work and influence of Jesus during 
                the earlier part of his ministry. They are a general statement, the details of 
                which are given in the subsequent chapters of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and 
                Luke--the Gospel of John dealing more particularly with the work in 
                Jud&aelig;a</span>),  into their synagogues throughout all 
            Galilee,  teaching in their synagogues (<span class="comm">The word 
                "synagogue" is compounded of the two Greek words "sun,
                " together, and "ago," to collect. It is, therefore, 
                equivalent to our English word "meeting-house." Tradition and the 
                Targums say that these Jewish houses of worship existed from the earliest 
                times. In proof of this assertion <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 31: 11</span> and <span class="style7">Psalms 74: 8</span> are cited. But the citations are insufficient, that 
                in Deuteronomy not being in point, and the seventy-fourth Psalm being probably 
                written after the Babylonian captivity. It better accords with history to 
                believe that the synagogue originated during the Babylonian captivity, and was 
                brought into the motherland by the returning exiles. Certain it is that the 
                synagogue only came into historic prominence after the books of the Old 
                Testament were written. At the time of our Saviour's ministry synagogues were 
                scattered all over Palestine, and also over all quarters of the earth whither 
                the Jews had been dispersed. Synagogues were found in very small villages, for 
                wherever ten "men of leisure," willing and able to devote 
                themselves to the service of the synagogue, were found, a synagogue might be 
                erected. In the synagogues the people met together on the Sabbaths to pray, and 
                to listen to the reading of the portions of the Old Testament, and also to hear 
                such instruction or exhortation as might be furnished. With the permission of 
                the president of the synagogue any one who was fitted might deliver an address. 
                Thus the synagogues furnished Jesus (<span class="comm">and in later times his disciples also</span>) 
                with a congregation 

                and a suitable place for preaching. We find 
                that on week days Jesus often preached in the open air. But the synagogues are 
                thus particularly mentioned, probably, because in them were held the most 
                important services, because they were necessary during the rainy and cold 
                season, and because their use shows that as yet the Jewish rulers had not so 
                prejudiced the public mind as to exclude Jesus from the houses of worship</span>)
            , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,  and 
            casting out demons (<span class="comm">Mark singles out this kind of miracle as most striking 
                and wonderful</span>),  and healing all manner of disease 
            and all manner of sickness among the people. 
        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">Matthew 4: 24</span>  And the report of 
            him went forth into all Syria (<span class="comm">caravans passing through Galilee back and 
                forth between the Mediterranean seaports on the west and the Persian cities on 
                the east, and between Damascus on the north and Egypt on the south, would carry 
                the reports concerning Jesus far and wide</span>): and they brought unto him 
            all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with 
            demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them. (<span class="comm">Thus, by his 
                actions, Jesus showed that the kingdom of God had come. The wonders of Moses 
                were mostly miracles of judgment, those of Jesus were acts of compassion. The 
                diseases here enumerated are still among the most difficult for physicians to 
                handle. The term "palsy" included all forms of paralysis, 
                catalepsy, and cramps.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span>   And there followed him great multitudes 
            (<span class="comm">these popular demonstration, no doubt, intensified the erroneous notion of his 
                disciples that the kingdom of Jesus was to be one of worldly grandeur</span>) from 
            Galilee and Decapolis (<span class="comm">Decapolis is formed from the two Greek words 
                "deka," ten, and "polis," city. As a 
                geographical term, Decapolis refers to that part of Syria lying east, 
                southeast, and south of the Lake of Galilee. There is some doubt as to which 
                were the ten cities named, for there seem at times to have been fourteen of 
                them. Those commonly reckoned are 1. Damascus. 2. Philadelphia. 3. Raphana. 4. 
                Sycthopolis. 5. Gadara. 6. Hyppos. 7. Dion. 8. Pella. 9. Galas. 10. Kanatha. 
                The 

                other four are Abila and Kanata (<span class="comm">distinct from Kanatha</span>), 
                C&aelig;sarea Philippi, and Gergesa. None of these were in Galilee save 
                Sycthopolis. According to Ritter, these cities were colonized principally by 
                veterans from the army of Alexander the Great. A reminiscence of their 
                Macedonian origin is found in the fact that there was a city named Pella in 
                Macedonia. These cities are said to have been formed into a confederacy by 
                Pompey the Great. In the time of Jesus they were chiefly inhabited by Greeks or 
                heathens, and not by Jews. Josephus expressly calls Gadara and Hyppos Greek 
                cities</span>) and Jerusalem and Jud&aelig;a and 
            from beyond the Jordan. (<span class="comm">The land beyond Jordan was called 
                Per&aelig;a, which means "beyond." According to Josephus, it 
                included territory between the cities of Pella on the north and Mach&aelig;rus 
                on the south. That is to say, its northern boundary began on the Jordan 
                opposite the southern line of Galilee, and its southern boundary was at Moab, 
                about the middle of the east shore of the Dead Sea.</span>)     </p>
