        <h3>102. COST OF DISCIPLESHIP</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY PER&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 14: 25-35</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Now there went with him great multitudes (<span class="comm">he 
                had hitherto spent but little time in Per&aelig;a, and the people were availing 
                themselves of this opportunity to see and hear him</span>): and he turned, 
            and said unto them, </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not 
            his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, 
            yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 
            (<span class="comm">"Hateth," as used here, is an example of phenomenal speech, or 
                speaking from appearances. In the cases supposed, the person would appear
                to hate those whom he abandoned for Christ. It is like repent, anger, etc., 
                when spoken of God. To construe the passage literally as enjoining hatred would 
                be contrary to the fifth commandment as re-enacted at <span class="style7">Ephesians 6: 1-3 </span>and <span class="style7"> Colossians 3: 20</span>; and also contrary to our Lord's own example (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 19: 25-27</span></span>). Seeing the number of those adherents which now 
                surrounded him, Jesus made use of this striking statement that he might startle 
                each hearer, and impress upon him the wide difference between a 
                mere outward appearance upon him and a real, disciple-like adhesion to him. The 
                latter requires that we be ready to sacrifice all, even our animal life, in so 
                far as it tends to separate from Christ <span class="style7">Romams 12: 11; Acts 20: 24</span>.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> And whosoever doth not bear his own 
            cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. (<span class="comm">Christ must be followed 
                and imitated even to the extremity of suffering. The costliness of discipleship 
                is illustrated in the two brief parables which follow.</span>)</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> For which of you, 
            desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether 
            he have wherewith to complete 
            it? </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span>  Lest haply, when he hath laid the foundation, and is not 
            able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him, 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> saying, This 
            man began to build, and was not able to finish. (<span class="comm">Discipleship is 
                character-building, and shame awaits him who attempts to be a Christian and 
                fails to live up to his profession. Unless his tower rises to the heavenly 
                heights to which it aspired, it is but a Babel at last. The parable is not 
                intended to discourage anyone from attempting to be a disciple. It is meant to 
                warn us against attempting so great an undertaking with the frivolity of spirit 
                and want of determination which insure failure.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> Or what king, as he 
            goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take 
            counsel, whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against 
            him with twenty thousand? 
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> Or else, while the other is yet a 
            great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace. (<span class="comm">Is 
                the adversary here God or the devil? As warring against God is no part of 
                discipleship, it might seem that the conflict was with Satan. But the case 
                supposed is that of a man who, after counting the cost, is about to decline 
                taking up his cross--about to rebel against the claims of God. But while 
                in this rebellious state he sees a superior force coming against him. This 
                superior force can not be the devil's, for Jesus could not counsel any to make 
                peace with him, as the parable advises. The superior force, then, is God's, and 
                the lesson here is that however fearful the task of being a 
                disciple may be, it is not so dreadful as to fight against God. As soon as the 
                hesitating man takes in his thought, he will immediately take up the cross 
                which he was about to refuse.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> So therefore whosoever he be of you that 
            renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. (<span class="comm">The tower can 
                not be built by him who spends his time or squanders his money on other 
                enterprises, nor can the peace be maintained by one who does not fully renounce 
                his rebellion.</span>) </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt have lost 
            its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned? </p>

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> It is fit neither 
            for the land nor for the dunghill: men
            cast it out. (<span class="comm">Our Lord twice before used such language. See 
                pp. 234, 433. Salt is here used as a symbol of perseverance. The condition of 
                those who begin the Christian life and fail to persevere is dangerous in the 
                extreme <span class="style7">Hebrews 6: 4-12; 10: 26-39</span>.</span>) He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. (<span class="comm">See p. 330.</span>)</p>
