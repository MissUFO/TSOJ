        <h3>27. ARRIVAL IN GALILEE.</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 4: 14; JOHN 4: 43, 45</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span>     And after the two days (<span class="comm">the two days spent 
                among the Samaritans at Sychar</span>) he went forth from thence (<span class="comm">from Samaria</span>) 
            into Galilee.  14 And Jesus returned in the 
            power of the Spirit into Galilee (<span class="comm">Power of the Spirit here means its 
                manifest use to perform miracles, rather than its presence, influence or 
                direction. Jesus was always under the influence and direction of the Spirit, 
                but did not previously perform miracles</span>):    </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span>   For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own 
            country. (<span class="comm">Galilee was Jesus' "own country" (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 1: 46; 2: 1; 7: 3, 41, 52; Luke 23: 5-7</span></span>). In Jud&aelig;a he had begun to receive so much honor as 
                to bring him into danger at the hands of the Pharisees: he would receive less 
                in Galilee. <span class="style7">John 4: 43 </span>resumes the 
                itinerary of <span class="style7">John 4: 1, 2,</span> after the 
                interlude which tells of the woman at Sychar.</span>) </p>





        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span>    So when he came into 
            Galilee, the Galil&aelig;ans received him, having seen all the things that he 
            did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. (<span class="comm">The 
                works which Jesus had done in Jerusalem were for the most part fruitless as to 
                its inhabitants, but they bore the fruit of faith in far-off Galilee. Of 
                "the many who believed on him" in Jerusalem (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 2: 23</span></span>), it is highly probable that a large number were 
                Galil&aelig;an pilgrims who were then there attending the passover.</span>)</p>
