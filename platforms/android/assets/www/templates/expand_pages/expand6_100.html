        <h3>100. THE STRAIT GATE.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PER&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 13: 22-35.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> And he went on his way through cities and villages, 
            teaching, and journeying on unto Jerusalem. (<span class="comm">This verse probably refers 
                back to <span class="style7">Luke 13: 10</span>, and indicates that 
                Jesus resumed his journey after the brief rest on the Sabbath day when he 
                healed the woman with the curvature of the spine.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> And one said unto him, 
            Lord, are they few that are saved? (<span class="comm">It is likely that this question was 
                asked by a Jew, and that the two parables illustrating the smallness of the 
                kingdom's beginning suggested it to him. The Jews extended their exclusive 
                spirit even to their ideals of a world to come, so that they believed none but 
                the chosen race would behold its glories. The circumstances attending to the 
                conversion of Cornelius, recorded in Acts, show how this exclusiveness survived 
                even among Jewish Christians. The questioner wished Jesus to commit himself to 
                this narrow Jewish spirit, or else to take a position which would subject him 
                to the charge of being unpatriotic.</span>) And he said unto them,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> Strive (<span class="comm">literally, agonize</span>) to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I 
            say unto 

            you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be 
            able. (<span class="comm">Jesus answers that many shall be excluded from the kingdom, 
                and that the questioner, and all others who hear, need to exercise themselves 
                and give the matter their own personal attention lest they be among that many. 
                The passage should be compared with that in Matthew, p. 266. There one enters 
                by a narrow gate upon a narrow road, indicating the strictness of the Christian 
                life. Here one enters by a narrow door upon a season of festivity, indicating 
                the joyous privileges of a Christian life.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> When once the master of the 
            house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, 
            and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say 
            to you, I know you not whence ye are (<span class="comm">This verse gives the reason why one 
                should strive to enter in. The time for entrance is limited, and he must 
                get in before it expires; for when the limited time has passed, he can not 
                enter, no matter how earnestly he may seek or strive. Our Lord pictures a 
                householder who refuses to receive any guest that has shown contempt for his 
                feast by coming late. The strict spirit of the Lord in giving his invitation is 
                indicated by the phrase "narrow door," but the phrase includes more 
                than this, for those who would strive must not only be prompt to act, but must 
                be painstaking so as to act intelligently, and of obedient spirit so as to act 
                acceptably</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> then ye shall begin to say (<span class="comm">in answer to the 
                Lord's statement that he does not know them</span>), We did eat and drink in 
            thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets (<span class="comm">Thus they idly urged 
                their privileges to him who was condemning them for having neglected to make a 
                proper use of those privileges. Had these privileges been valued and improved, 
                the clamoring outcasts would have been inside and not outside the door</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, 
            all ye workers of iniquity. (<span class="comm">Thus pleading avails not. The door would not 
                be narrow if it opened to excuses.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> There shall be the weeping and the 
            gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and 

            Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast 
            forth without. (<span class="comm">See pp. 273 and 274.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> And they shall come from the 
            east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom 
            of God. (<span class="comm">See p. 273.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> And behold (<span class="comm">little as you may think it</span>)
            , there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be 
            last. (<span class="comm">A familiar proverb of Christ's (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 19: 30; 20: 10</span></span>), to be interpreted by such passages as <span class="style7">Matthew 21: 31</span> and <span class="style7">Romans 9: 30-31</span>. The Jew who 
                thought the Gentile had no hope at all, and that he himself was sure of 
                salvation, would be surprised to find that his opinion was the very reverse of 
                the real fact as time developed it.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> In that very hour there came certain 
            Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill 
            thee. (<span class="comm">This shows that Jesus was in the territory of Herod Antipas, and 
                hence probably in Per&aelig;a. The Pharisees, no doubt, wished to scare Jesus 
                that they might exult over his fright. We might suppose, too, that their words 
                were untrue, were it not that Jesus sends a reply to Herod. Herod long desired 
                to see Jesus (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 9: 9; 23: 8</span></span>), but 
                it was not likely that he desired to put him to death. He was, doubtless, glad 
                enough to get Jesus out of his territory, lest he might foment an uprising, and 
                to this end he employed this strategy of sending messengers to warn Jesus under 
                the guise of friendship.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> And he said unto them, Go and say to that 
            fox (<span class="comm">i.e., say to that crafty, sly fellow. The fox is a type of 
                craftiness and treachery. We have no other instance where Jesus used such a 
                contemptuous expression; but Herod richly merited it. An Idum&aelig;an by his 
                father, a Samaritan by his mother, a Jew by profession, and a heathen by 
                practice, he had need to be foxy by nature. And he was even now playing the fox 
                by sending these messengers</span>), Behold, I cast out demons and perform 
            cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am perfected.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span> Nevertheless (<span class="comm">although I know what 
                lies before me</span>) I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the day following: for 

            it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. (<span class="comm">Wieseler, Meyer, Alford, 
                and other able commentators think that the days mentioned in this difficult 
                passage are literal days. If the language is to be thus construed, the saying 
                amounts to a promise to leave Herod's territory in three days. Such 
                construction, however, is not consistent with the elevation of the sentiment 
                and the solemnity of its repetition. Three days are thus sometimes used 
                proverbially to designate a short time (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Hosea 6: 2</span></span>), and they are unquestionably so used here. The meaning then is 
                this: "For a little while I liberate and heal and abide in your territory 
                to disturb your peace. But in a few days I shall be perfected in my office as a 
                liberator and healer, after which I shall be seen no more in your territory. 
                And though I understand these plots against me, I must fill up my time and go 
                on my course till I suffer martyrdom at Jerusalem, which has the gruesome honor 
                of being the prophet-slaying city." This word "perfected" in 
                this passage finds its complement in the "It is finished" of 
                <span class="style7">John 19: 30</span>. Both the verbs are 
                derived from the Greek word telos, which means end or completion. 
                Compare also <span class="style7">2 Corinthians 12: 9; Philippians 3: 12; Hebrews 2: 10; 5: 8-9; 11: 40</span>. John the Baptist having perished at 
                Mach&aelig;rus in Per&aelig;a is regarded as an exception to this rule and the 
                prophets die at Jerusalem. The exception does not disprove the rule, if it be a 
                true exception; which may be questioned, since John died at the hands of Herod 
                and Herodias, neither of whom were, properly speaking Jews. John, therefore, 
                died as a prophet to foreigners rather than as a prophet to the Jewish people.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that 
            are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children 
            (<span class="comm">inhabitants</span>) together, even as a hen 
            gathereth her own brood under her wings, and ye would not! 
            (<span class="comm">Jesus repeated these words again as recorded in <span class="style7">Matthew 23: 37-39</span>. With such beautiful imagery does 
                Jesus set forth his tender love for the people of that city which he knew would 
                soon compass his death.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span> Behold, your house (<span class="comm">temple</span>) is left 
            unto 

            you desolate
            (<span class="comm">he was about to withdraw from the temple, which for centuries to 
                come was to be visited by no heavenly messenger whatever</span>): and I say 
            unto you, Ye shall not see me, until ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the 
            Lord. (<span class="comm">It is hardly possible that these words can refer to the triumphal 
                entry for their fulfillment (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 21: 9</span></span>). The use of them on that occasion may have had no reference to his 
                prediction. They undoubtedly refer to the Parousia, or second coming of the 
                Lord in his glory, before which time the Jews must turn and believe (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 11: 25-27</span> Not until they were 
                    thus prepared would they again see him without whom they were now rejecting.</span>)
