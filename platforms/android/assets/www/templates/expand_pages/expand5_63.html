        <h3>63. HIS APPROACHING PASSION.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 12: 1-59.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span>   In the meantime (<span class="comm">that is, while these things 
                were occurring in the Pharisee's house</span>), when the many thousands of 
            the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one upon 
            another (<span class="comm">in their eagerness to get near enough to Jesus to see and hear</span>)
            , he began to say unto his disciples first of all (<span class="comm">that is, as the 
                first or most appropriate lesson</span>), Beware ye of the leaven of the 
            Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. (<span class="comm">This admonition is the key to the 
                understanding of the principal part of the sermon which follows. The spirit of 
                Phariseeism was one which sought the honor of men, and feared men rather than 
                God. It was a spirit which yielded to public opinion, and, though seemingly 
                very religious, was really devoid of all true loyalty to God. There were trials 
                and persecutions ahead of Christ's followers in which no Pharisaic spirit could 
                survive. The spirit of hypocrisy works in two ways: it causes the bad man to 
                hide his badness for fear of the good man, and the good man to hide his 
                goodness for fear of the bad man. It is this latter operation against which 
                Jesus warns, and the folly of 

                which he shows.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span>   But there is 
            nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be 
            known.   </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span>   Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall 
            be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers 
            shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. (<span class="comm">Many fearing the storm of 
                persecution which was soon to come upon the disciples would attempt to conceal 
                their faith, but the attempt would be vain, for one could not even trust his 
                own family (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">verses 51-53</span></span>) to 
                keep silent about what was said even in the inner chambers of the home. Bold 
                speech would be best. The flat tops of Eastern houses were places from whence 
                public proclamations were made.</span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span>    And I say unto you my friends, Be not 
            afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can 
            do.   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span>   But I will warn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after 
            he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. 
            (<span class="comm">It would be a time of fear, but the fear of God must dominate the fear of man. 
                The fear of God should cause them to speak out, though the fear of man bade 
                them be silent--<span class="style7">Acts 4: 18-21.</span></span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span>   Are not five sparrows sold for two pence? and not 
            one of them is forgotten in the sight of God? (<span class="comm">The Roman as here 
                rendered penny, was worth about four-fifths of a cent. Two sparrows were sold 
                for a penny (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Matthew 10: 29</span></span>). For two 
                pennies, an extra one was thrown into the bargain, yet even it, so valueless, 
                was not forgotten of God.</span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span>  But the very hairs of your head are all 
            numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows. (<span class="comm">These words 
                assured them that whatever they might be called upon to undergo they would be 
                at all times the objects of God's special care and providence.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span>   Also I say 
            unto you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man 
            also confess before the angels of God: 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span>   but he that denieth me in 
            the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God. 
            (<span class="comm">These words were intended to strengthen those who loved honor or 

                feared disgrace. If the disgrace of being cast out of the synagogue tempted 
                them to deny Christ, or the honors given by their fellow-men seemed too 
                precious to be sanctified for Christ's sake, they were to remember that the 
                confession or denial of Jesus involved eternal honor or disgrace in the 
                presence of the angelic host.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span>  And every one who shall speak a word 
            against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth 
            against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven. (<span class="comm">Persecution would urge 
                them to blasphemy (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 26: 11</span></span>). In 
                his hour of trial a disciple must remember the tender compassion of the Master 
                against whom he is urged to speak, and the extreme danger of passing beyond the 
                line of forgiveness in his blasphemy. For blasphemy against the Holy Spirit see 
                page 303.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span>   And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, 
            and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye 
            shall say:   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span>   for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very 
            hour what ye ought to say. (<span class="comm">The captive disciple planning his defense would 
                be tempted to attempt hypocritical concealment or dissimulation. To prevent 
                this, Jesus admonishes his hearers to rely upon the Holy Spirit for their 
                utterance at such times. How fully such reliance was honored is shown in the 
                apology of Stephen before the Sanhedrin, in Peter's defense before the 
                tribunal, and in Paul's justification of his course, both before Felix and 
                Agrippa.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span>   And one out of the multitude said unto him, Teacher, bid my 
            brother divide the inheritance with me. (<span class="comm">Some one in the multitude, seeing 
                the authority and justice of Jesus, thought it would be wise to appeal to him 
                to assist him in getting his brother to rightly divide the inheritance.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span>   But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 
            (<span class="comm">Jesus laid down the general laws of justice and generosity, but he did not 
                enforce these laws by any other power than love (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 14</span></span>). If love toward Jesus did not move this brother to 
                rightly divide the inheritance, the injured party must look to the state and 
                not to Jesus for 

                assistance.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>  And he said unto them, Take 
            heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness (<span class="comm">Jesus made the incident 
                the text for an admonition. Covetousness made one brother say, 
                "Divide," and the other one say, "No, I will not;" so 
                Jesus warned against covetousness</span>): for a man's life consisteth not 
            in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. (<span class="comm">A man's goods are no 
                part of his life, and so they can not preserve it. It is lengthened or 
                shortened, blessed or cursed, at the decree of God. Covetousness is an 
                inordinate desire for earthly possession. Though all ages have committed it, it 
                is the besetting sin of our time. A clear view of the limitations of the power 
                of property quenches covetousness; and Jesus gives such a view in the following 
                parable.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span>  And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a 
            certain rich man brought forth plentifully (<span class="comm">This man's sin was not theft or 
                extortion. His wealth came to him honestly as a blessing from God</span>):   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span>  and he reasoned within himself, saying (<span class="comm">his words betray his 
                sin--his covetousness</span>), What shall I do, because I have not 
            where to bestow my fruits?  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span>   And he said, This will I do: I will 
            pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and 
            my goods. 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span>   And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much 
            goods (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Proverbs 1: 32</span></span>) laid up for 
            many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry. (<span class="comm">It is a short speech, 
                but it reveals character. The man's selfishness is shown in that he uses the 
                pronoun "I" six times, and says nothing of anyone else. His 
                covetous love of possessions is shown by the word "my," which he 
                uses five times. Compare his words with those of Nabal at <span class="style7">1 Samuel 25: 11</span>. In his speech to his soul he 
                asserts his trust that his "abundance" is a guarantee of 
                "many years" of happy life; but it did not guarantee one day. The 
                Eastern barn is a pit or dry cistern built underground with an opening at the 
                top. These the man proposed to enlarge by pulling down the walls or sides and 
                extending them.</span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span>   But God said unto him (<span class="comm">God may be represented as 
                saying what he does</span>), Thou foolish 

            one (<span class="comm">His 
                folly was shown in several ways: 1. He hoarded his goods instead of using them 
                for his fellow-men; 2. Ownership of goods deceived him into thinking that he 
                owned time also; 3. He thought to satisfy the hunger of the soul with the food 
                of the body; 4. In commanding his soul in such a way as to show that he forgot 
                that God could command it also</span>), this night is thy soul required of 
            thee (<span class="comm">the man said "many years," but God said "this 
                night"</span>); and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall 
            they be? (<span class="comm">Death generally scatters possessions broadcast (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Psalms 39: 6; Ecclesiastes 2: 18, 19</span></span>). For an echo of 
                these words see <span class="style7">James 4: 13-15.</span></span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span>  So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward 
            God. (<span class="comm">To be rich in character is to be rich toward God. But we may be rich 
                towards him by making him the repository of our hopes and expectations.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span>  And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for
            your life, what ye shall eat; nor 
            yet for your body, what ye shall put on. 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span>   For the life is more 
            than the food, and the body than the raiment.  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span>  Consider the 
            ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span>  And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his

            why are ye anxious concerning the rest? (<span class="comm">If you can not add one little 
                moment to your life, why should you be anxious about the smaller concerns of 
                property?</span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span>   Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do 
            they spin; yet I saw unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Song 3: 6-11</span></span>) was not arrayed like 
            one of these.   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span>  But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span>   Fear not, little flock; 
            for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">33</span>   Sell that which ye have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax 
            not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">34</span>  For where your treasure is, 
            there will your heart be also. (<span class="comm">The latter part of this section will be 
                found at <span class="style7">Matthew 6: 20, 21.</span> See page 256. 
                The original for the words "little flock" is a double diminutive, 
                indicating at once the extreme smallness of the band of disciples, and also the 
                tenderness of the Master for them. They are exhorted to remember that they are 
                the heirs of the heavenly kingdom, and that their treasures are there. They are 
                told to sell their possessions and give, because their official position in the 
                kingdom at that time required it. Compare <span class="style7">1 Corinthians 7: 36.</span> Purses were bound to the girdles, so that if a hole wore in 
                them, their contents were lost. Having discussed the folly of amassing and 
                trusting in earthly riches, and the wisdom of trusting in God, and amassing 
                heavenly riches, Jesus passes to a new theme; viz.: a watchful service and its 
                rewards. He may have been led into this theme by some interruption, such as 
                that given at verse <span class="style7">13 </span>or that at 
                verse <span class="style7">41</span>, or it may have been suggested 
                to him by his own words about the little flock and the kingdom. The kingdom was 
                not to come in a day, and the little flock must watch patiently and serve 
                faithfully before his coming--<span class="style7">Luke 19: 11-13.</span></span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">35</span>  Let your loins be girded about (<span class="comm">the long 
                Oriental robe had to be lifted up and girded at the waist before the feet could

            when he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open unto 
            him. (<span class="comm">Thus honoring him by a speedy welcome.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span>   Blessed are those 
            servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto 
            you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and shall come 
            and serve them. (<span class="comm">The apostles had a foretaste of this honor on the evening

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span>  And if he shall come in the second watch, and if in the

                following the Romans, they now had four watches. The second and third watches 
                lasted from 9 P. M. to 3 A. M. The first watch is not mentioned because the 
                marriage took place in it, and the fourth is not mentioned because in the 
                latter part of it the day dawns and the virtue of watching was 
                over--<span class="style7">Luke 13: 35.</span></span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span>   But 
            know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was 
            coming, he would have watched, and not have left his house to be broken 
            through. (<span class="comm">Jesus here illustrates watchfulness by a second figure. To some 
                the coming of Jesus will be like that of a master whom they have served more or 
                less faithfully. To others his coming will seem like that of a plunderer who 
                comes in suddenly and deprives them of all they have. The Oriental houses were 
                mostly made of mud or sun-dried bricks. Hence it was so easy to dig a hole in 
                the wall than that the thief preferred to enter that way rather than to break 
                open the door.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span>   Be ye also ready: for in an hour that ye think not the 
            Son of man cometh. (<span class="comm">These words of warning confront every generation.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span>   And Peter said, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto 
            all? (<span class="comm">Peter wished to know if the exhortation to watchfulness applied 
                merely to the apostles or to all who heard.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span>  And the Lord said, Who then 
            is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, 
            to give them their portion of food in due season?   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span>   Blessed is 
            that servant, whom his 

            lord when he cometh shall find so 
            doing. (<span class="comm">The answer of Jesus shows that he especially addressed the 
                disciples, for a steward is distinct from the household. On him the whole 
                burden and care of the domestic establishment rested. Thus Jesus showed that he 
                meant the disciples, yet did not exclude any who heard from profiting by his 
                discourse. Fidelity is the first requisite in a steward, and wisdom is the 
                second. All Christians are stewards; preachers, elders, Sunday-school teachers, 
                etc., are stewards of place and office. Rich men, fathers, etc., are stewards 
                of influence and possessions.</span>)  </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span>  Of a truth I say unto you, that he will 
            set him over all that he hath. (<span class="comm">As Pharaoh exalted Joseph--<span class="style7">Genesis 39: 4; 41: 39-41</span>.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span>  But if 
            that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall 
            begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and 
            to be drunken;   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span>  the lord of that servant shall come in a day 
            when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut him 
            asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful. (<span class="comm">Cutting asunder 
                was a punishment prevalent among ancient nations (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">2 Samuel 12: 31; Daniel 2: 5; Hebrews 11: 37</span></span>). The definite punishment 
                is part of the drapery of the parable, and does not necessarily indicate the 
                exact nature of the punishment which will be inflicted upon the wicked.</span>)   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span>   And that servant, who knew his lord's will, and made not ready, nor did 
            according to his will, shall be beaten with many 
            stripes.   </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span>  but he that knew not, and did things 
            worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few 
            stripes. And to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be 
            required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more. (<span class="comm">The 
                greater the powers and opportunities entrusted to us, the larger the service 
                which the Lord requires of us. Ignorance does not entirely excuse, for we are 
                stewards, and it is the steward's duty to know his master's will. There is a 
                guilt of ignorance as well as of transgression. The parable pointed to those 
                who listened with delight to Jesus, but were careless about 

                knowing his meaning. With the forty-ninth verse Jesus passes on to set forth the severe tests to which the 
                fidelity and vigilance of his disciples would be subjected in the times upon 
                which they were about to enter.</span>) 
        </p>



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span>   I came to cast fire (<span class="comm">a firebrand</span>) 
            upon the earth; and what do I desire, if it is already kindled? (<span class="comm">The object 
                of Christ's coming was to rouse men to spiritual conflict, to kindle a fire in 
                the public mind which would purify the better part and destroy the worse. But 
                the burning of this fire would excite men and stir up their passions and cause 
                division and discord. The opposition of the Pharisees showed that this fire was 
                already kindled. What therefore was left for Jesus to desire? His work as a 
                teacher was practically accomplished. But there remained for him yet his duty 
                as priest to offer himself as a sacrifice for the world's sin. To this work, 
                therefore, he glances briefly forward.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span>  for there shall be from 
            henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against

        </p>


        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">53</span>   They shall be divided, father against son, and son

            mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her 
            mother in law. (<span class="comm">Jesus here shows the hard plight of the disciple. If he 
                were the young son he would find his father against him, and if he were the 
                aged father he would be persecuted by the boy whom he had raised. Jesus came to 
                conquer a peace by overcoming evil with good; a conflict in which the good must 
                always suffer. His warfare was not, as the people supposed, a struggle against 
                the heathen, but against the evil within them and around them. So long as evil 
                abounded, these unhappy divisions would last.</span>)

                political storm arising out of conflict with Rome impending over them, and with 
                the spiritual storm which the teaching of Christ was bringing upon them, about 
                to burst, they stood still in ignorant indifference, and made no provision for
