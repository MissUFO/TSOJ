        <h3>103D. SECOND GROUP OF PARABLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY IN PER&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>THE LOST SON</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 15: 11-32</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And he said, A certain man had two sons (<span class="comm">These 
                    two sons represent the professedly religious (<span class="comm">the elder</span>) and the openly 
                    irreligious (<span class="comm">the younger</span>). They have special reference to the two parties found 
                    in the first two verses of <span class="style7">Luke 15</span>
                    the Pharisees, the publicans and sinners</span>): </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> and the younger of them (<span class="comm">the more childish and easily deceived</span>) said to his 
                father, Father, give me the portion of thy
                substance that falleth to me. (<span class="comm">Since the elder brother 
                    received a double portion, the younger brother's part would be only one-third 
                    of the property <span class="style7">Deuteronomy 21: 17</span></span>) 
                And he divided unto them his living. (<span class="comm">Abraham so divided his estate in 
                    his lifetime (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 25: 1-6</span></span>); 
                    but the custom does not appear to have been general among the Jews. God, 
                    however, gives gifts and talents to us all, so the parable fits the facts of 
                    life <span class="style7">Psalm 145: 9; Matthew 5: 45; Acts 10: 34</span></span>).</span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> And not many days after (<span class="comm">with all haste</span>), 
                the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far 
                country. (<span class="comm">He yearned for the spurious liberty of a land where he would be 
                    wholly independent of his father. Thus the sinful soul seeks to escape from the 
                    authority of God</span>); and there he wasted his substance with riotous 
                living. (<span class="comm">Sin now indulges itself with unbridled license, and the parable 
                    depicts the sinner's course: his season of indulgences (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 15: 12, 13</span></span>); his misery (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 15: 14-16</span></span>); his repentance (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 15: 17-20</span></span>); 
                    his forgiveness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 15: 20-24</span></span>).</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty 
                famine in that country; and he began to be in want. (<span class="comm">Sooner or later sinful 
                    practices fail to satisfy, and the sense of famine and want mark the crises in 
                    our lives as they did in the life of the prodigal. The direst famine is that of 
                    the word of God <span class="style7">Amos 8: 11-13; Jeremiah 2: 13</span>.</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span> And he went and joined (<span class="comm">literally, glued</span>) 
                himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields 
                to feed (<span class="comm">literally, to pasture or tend</span>) swine. (<span class="comm">This was, to the 
                    Jew, the bottom of degradation's pit. They so abhorred swine that they refused 
                    to name them. They spoke of a pig as dabhar acheer; i. e., "the 
                    other thing."</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> And he would fain have filled his belly with the 
                husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. (<span class="comm">The master upon 
                    whom he had forced himself did not deem his services worthy of enough food to 
                    sustain life; so that he would gladly have eaten the husks or pods of the carob 
                    bean, which are very similar to our 

                    honey-locust pods, if they 
                    would have satisfied his hunger.</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> But when he came to himself (<span class="comm">his previous state had been one of delusion and semi-madness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Ecclesiastes 9: 3</span></span>); in it his chief desire had been to get away from 
                    home, but returning reason begets a longing to return thither</span>) he said, How 
                many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish 
                here with hunger! </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> I will arise and go to my father, and will 
                say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired 
                servants. (<span class="comm">The humility of his confession indicates that the term 
                    "riotous living" means more than merely a reckless expenditure of 
                    money. But vile as he was he trusted that his father's love was sufficient to 
                    do something for him.</span>)
            </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And he arose, and came to his father. (<span class="comm">Repentance is here pictured as a journey. It is more than a mere emotion or 
                    impulse.</span>) But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him (<span class="comm">being 
                    evidently on the lookout for him</span>), and was moved with compassion 
                (<span class="comm">seeing his ragged, pitiable condition</span>), and ran, and fell on his 
                neck, and kissed him. (<span class="comm">Giving him as warm a welcome as if he had been a 
                    model son.</span>)
            </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against 
                heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son. (<span class="comm">The 
                    son shows a manly spirit in adhering to his purpose to make a confession, 
                    notwithstanding the warmth of his father's welcome; in grieving for what he had 
                    done, and not for what he had lost; and in blaming no one but himself.</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">22</span> 
                But the father said to his servants (<span class="comm">interrupting the son in his 
                    confession</span>), Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; 
                and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet (<span class="comm">none but servants went 
                    barefooted</span>):</span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">23</span> and bring the fatted calf (<span class="comm">which, according to Eastern custom, was held in readiness for some great occasion (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 18: 7; 1 Samuel 28: 24; 2 Samuel 6: 13</span> </span>), and which some custom still exists</span>), and kill it, and let us eat, and make merry (<span class="comm">the robe, ring, etc., are merely part of the parabolic drapery, and are so many sweet assurances of full restoration and forgiveness, and are not to be pressed beyond this</span>):</span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">24</span> for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was 
                lost, and is found. (<span class="comm">The condition of the impenitent sinner is frequently 
                    expressed in the Bible under the metaphor of death <span class="style7">Romans 6: 13; Ephesians 2: 1; 5: 14; Revelation 3: 1</span>.</span>) And they 
                began to be merry. (<span class="comm">Having thus finished his account of the openly 
                    irreligious, Jesus now turns to portray that of the professedly religious; 
                    i. e., he turns from the publican to the Pharisee. He paints both parties 
                    as alike children of God, as both faulty and sinful in his sight, and each as 
                    being loved despite his faultiness. But while the story of the elder son had a 
                    present and local application to the Pharisees, it is to be taken 
                    comprehensively as describing all the self-righteous who murmur at and refuse 
                    to take part in the conversion of sinners.</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">25</span> Now his elder son was in the 
                field (<span class="comm">at work</span>): and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he 
                heard music and dancing. (<span class="comm">He heard evidences of joy, a joy answering to 
                    that mentioned at <span class="style7">Luke 15: 7 and 10</span>; the 
                    joy of angels in seeing the publicans and sinners repenting and being received 
                    by Jesus the joy at which the Pharisees had murmured.</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">26</span> And he 
                called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be.</span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">27</span> And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath 
                killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">28</span> But he was angry, and would not go in (<span class="comm">he refused to be a party to 
                    such a proceeding</span>): and his father came out, and entreated him. 
                (<span class="comm">In the entreating father Jesus pictures the desire and effort of God then and 
                    long afterwards put forth to win the proud, exclusive, self-righteous spirits 
                    which filled the Pharisees and other Jews <span class="style7">Luke 13: 34; Acts 13: 44-46; 28: 22-28</span>.</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">29</span> But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee
                (<span class="comm">literally, I am thy slave</span>), and I never transgressed a commandment 
                of thine (<span class="comm">He speaks with the true Pharisaic spirit 

                    (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 18: 11, 12; Romans 3: 9</span></span>). His 
                    justification was as proud as the prodigal's confession was humble</span>); 
                and yet thou never gavest me a 
                kid (<span class="comm">much less a calf</span>), that I might make merry with my 
                friends (<span class="comm">he reckons as a slave, so much pay for so much work, and his 
                    complaint suggests that he might have been as self-indulgent as his brother had 
                    he not been restrained by prudence</span>): </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">30</span> but when this thy son (<span class="comm">he thus openly disclaims him as a brother</span>) came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots (<span class="comm">and not decent friends such as mine</span>), thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">31</span> And he said unto him, Son, thou 
                art ever with me (<span class="comm">a privilege which the elder brother had counted as 
                    naught, or rather as slavery</span>), and all that is mine is thine. 
                (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Romans 9: 4, 5</span>. The younger brother 
                    had the shoes, etc., but the elder still had the inheritance.</span>) </span></p>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style4"><span class="style5">32</span> But it was 
                meet to make merry and be glad (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Acts 11: 18</span></span>): for this thy brother was dead, and is alive
                again; and was lost and is found. (<span class="comm">Here the story 
                    ends. We are not told how the elder brother acted, but we may read his history 
                    in that of the Jews who refused to rejoice with Jesus in the salvation of 
                    sinners. At the next Passover they carried their resentment against him to the 
                    point of murder, and some forty years later the inheritance was taken from 
                    them. Thus we see that the elder brother was not pacified by the father. He 
                    continued to rebel against the father's will till he himself became the lost 
                    son. A comparison of the three preceding parables brings out many suggestive 
                    points, thus: The first parable illustrates Christ's compassion. A sentient, 
                    suffering creature is lost, and it was bad for it that it should be so. 
                    Hence it must be sought, though its value is only one out of a hundred. Man's 
                    lost condition makes him wretched. The second parable shows us how God values a 
                    soul. A lifeless piece of metal is lost, and while it could not be pitied, it 
                    could be valued, and since its value was one out ten, it was bad for the 
                    owner that it should be lost. God looks upon man's loss as his 
                    impoverishment. The first two parables depict the efforts of Christ in the 
                    salvation of man, or that 

                    side of conversion more apparent, so to 
                    speak, to God; while the third sets forth the responsive efforts put forth by 
                    man to avail himself of God's salvation--the side of conversion more 
                    apparent to us. Moreover, as the parabolic figures become more nearly literal, 
                    as we pass from sheep and coin to son, the values also rise, and instead of one 
                    from a hundred, or one from ten, we have one out of two!</span>)
