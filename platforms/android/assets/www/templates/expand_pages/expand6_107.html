        <h3>107. PARABLE OF THE IMPORTUNATE WIDOW.</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 18: 1-8.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5"></span> 



        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span>  And he spake a parable unto them to the end that 
            they ought always to pray, and not to faint; 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span>  saying, There was in a city a 
            judge, who feared not God, and regarded not man (<span class="comm">an utterly abandoned 
                character</span>): 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge me of (<span class="comm">rather, Do justice to me as to</span>) mine adversary. (<span class="comm">In Scripture language widowhood is symbolic of defenselessness (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Exodus 22: 22-24; Deuteronomy 10: 18; 27: 19; Malachi 3: 5; Mark 12: 40</span></span>), and the early church concerned itself much about the welfare of widows--<span class="style7">Acts 6: 1; 9: 41; James 1: 27; 1 Timothy 5: 3</span>.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> And he would not for a 
            while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard 
            man; 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me 
            out by her continual coming. (<span class="comm">The point of this soliloquy is this: Though 
                the high motives such as accountability to God for my office and my good name 
                and respect 

                among men do not lead me to do this woman justice, yet 
                will I do it simply to be rid of her importunity.</span>) 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> And the Lord said 
            (<span class="comm">this expression indicates that the Lord paused for a moment, that the parable 
                might be fully grasped before he made the application</span>), Hear what the 
            unrighteous judge saith. 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> And shall not God avenge his elect, that cry to him 
            day and night (<span class="comm">The application is an argument a fortiori, and 
                presents a triple antithesis: 1. In the petitioned--a just God and an 
                unrighteous judge. 2. In the petitioners--a despised widow and the beloved 
                elect. 3. In the petition--the frequent visits of the one, and the 
                continual cries of the many</span>), and 
            yet he is longsuffering over them? 

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? (<span class="comm">Though a beloved people cry continually unto a just God, yet will he in mercy be longsuffering to their enemies, and because of the longsuffering he will seem to delay his answer, but the delay will not be extended a moment longer than necessary. When the season of repentance is past, and the measure of iniquity is full (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Genesis 15: 16</span></span>), then the Lord's answer will be speedy, immediate. But 
                despite this admonition to pray without discouragement, and this promise to 
                answer with all speed, God's patience with the wicked, and his consequent 
                delays in answering the prayers of the just, will prove such a trial to his 
                people as to leave it questionable whether any of them will have faith enough 
                to pray until the coming of the Lord. We find an echo of this passage at <span class="style7">2 Peter 3: 1-13</span>. Compare also 
                <span class="style7">Matthew 24: 12, 13</span>. The parable resembles that of the friend who came at midnight (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">Luke 11: 5</span></span>), see p. 480, but 
                there the petitioner asked a gift, and here the request is for justice and 
                deliverance. And this parable also teaches that the saints must be patient in 
                prayer until the Lord's return.</span>)
