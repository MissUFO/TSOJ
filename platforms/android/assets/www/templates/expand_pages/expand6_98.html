        <h3>98. WOMAN HEALED ON THE SABBATH.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY PER&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 13: 10-21.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the 
            sabbath day. (<span class="comm">Our Lord's habit of teaching in the synagogue, which had been 
                for some time interrupted by his retirement, had probably been revived during 
                the mission of the seventy.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And behold, a woman that had a spirit of 
            infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift 
            herself up. (<span class="comm">The use of the word "spirit" in this verse 
                indicates that the curvature of the spine which afflicted this woman was 
                attributed to demoniacal agency.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> And when Jesus saw her, he called her, 
            and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and 
            glorified God.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">14</span> And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with 
            indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the 
            multitude, There are six days (<span class="comm">quite enough</span>) in which men ought to work: 
            in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath. 
            (<span class="comm">There is not evidence that the woman came with any intention of being healed, 
                nor was the ruler angry at her, but at Jesus. Too cowardly to openly rebuke 
                Jesus, the ruler fell to reprimanding the people, and thus indirectly censuring 
                the Lord.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">15</span>  But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not 
            each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead 
            him away to watering? (<span class="comm">The word "hypocrite" was among the 
                strongest ever used by our Lord. He here applies it to the whole class 

                to whom the ruler belonged and for whom he was the spokesman--the 
                class who are mentioned as "adversaries" in <span class="style7">Luke 13: 17</span>. Their hypocrisy appears in two ways: 1. They were 
                disguising their hatred toward Christ under a pretended zeal for the Sabbath. 
                2. Their zeal for the Sabbath was at no time sincere, for they favored 
                indulgence where their own interests were involved, but applied their Sabbath 
                rules sharply where others were concerned. It was their tradition and not the 
                Sabbath which Jesus had broken, and he here attempts no other justification of 
                himself than to show that he is guiltless under a fair application of their own 
                precedents.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">16</span> And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom 
            Satan had bound, lo, these 
            eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the 
            sabbath? (<span class="comm">Taking their own conduct on the Sabbath day as the basis for his 
                justification, Jesus presents three contrasts, each of which made his action 
                better than theirs: 1. He had blessed the woman instead of an ox. 2. He had 
                loosed from a disease instead of from a comfortable stall. 3. He had relieved a 
                waiting of eighteen years' standing instead of one of some few hours' 
                duration--the brief time since the watering of the morning. He mentions 
                the woman's descent from Abraham because, according to their ideas, it made her 
                worthy of every consideration. In attributing the infirmity to Satan he 
                acknowledges the action of the demon as Satan's agent. Disease were not 
                infrequently ascribed to Satan and the demons--<span class="style7">Acts 10: 38; 2 Corinthians 12: 7</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">17</span> And as he said these 
            things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced 
            for all the glorious things that were done by him. (<span class="comm">The people rejoiced not 
                only in the miracle, but in that wisdom which silenced the narrow-minded 
                rulers. The triumph which they rejoiced in was but a slight foretaste of the 
                victories to come, and to point out the nature of those victories the Lord 
                spoke the two parables which follow.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">18</span> He said therefore, Unto what is the 
            kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">19</span> It is like 
            unto a grain of 

            mustard seed, which a man took, and cast 
            into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the 
            heaven lodged in the branches thereof.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">20</span> And again he said, 
            Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">21</span> It is like unto 
            leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all 
            leavened. (<span class="comm">For comment, see pp. 337, 338.</span>)
