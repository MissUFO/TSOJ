        <h3>PARABLES OF TREASURE.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 13: 44-53.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">44</span> The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in 
            the field; the which a man found, and hid; and 

            in his joy 
            he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. (<span class="comm">The three 
                parables in this section appear to have been addressed privately to the 
                disciples. In the absence of banks and other trust repositories, the men of 
                that day hid their treasures as best they could. The sudden death of the hider 
                often resulted in the loss of all knowledge as to the whereabouts of the 
                treasure. The parable speaks of such a lost treasure. Technically it belonged 
                to the owner of the field, but practically it belonged to him who found it. 
                Hence the finder conceals it again until he had made perfect his title to it by 
                the purchase of the field. The gist of the parable does not require us to pass 
                upon the conduct of the finder, which was certainly questionable.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">45</span> Again, 
            the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly 
            pearls:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">46</span> and having found one pearl of great price, he went and 
            sold all that he had, and bought it. (<span class="comm">In the preceding parable the treasure 
                was found by accident; in this, the pearl was sought. Some find without 
                seeking, as did the Samaritan woman (<span class="comm"><span class="style7">John 4: 28-29</span></span>); some only after diligent search, as did the eunuch--<span class="style7">Acts 8: 27</span>.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">47</span> Again, the kingdom 
            of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every 
            kind:

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">48</span> which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and 
            they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast 
            away.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">49</span> So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall 
            come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">50</span> and 
            shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the 
            gnashing of teeth. (<span class="comm">Like the parable of the tares, this one indicates the 
                continuance of the mixture of bad and good, and points to the final separation. 
                The contents of a net can not be sorted while it is being drawn. The tares 
                indicate such evils as can be seen and as tempt us to uproot them. The net 
                shows that in the dark and turbulent waters, and in the hurry-skurry of its 
                teeming life, there are things which can not be seen. The judgment shall be 
                with care, as when men, in the broad light of day, on the 

                quiet beach, sit down to sort the fish. If the parable of the tares emphasizes the 
                waiting, the parable of the net emphasizes the careful sorting.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">51</span> Have ye 
            understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">52</span> And he 
            said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the 
            kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which bringeth 
            forth out of his treasure things new and old. (<span class="comm">As a householder graces his 
                banquet with things already in the house, and with other things which have just 
                been provided, so a religious teacher must refresh his hearers out of both his 
                past and his present experiences and study. Old lessons must be clothed in new 
                garments.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">53</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, 
            he departed thence. (<span class="comm">He went from the house to the sea in the afternoon, 
                and entering a boat a little later, he stilled the storm.</span>)
