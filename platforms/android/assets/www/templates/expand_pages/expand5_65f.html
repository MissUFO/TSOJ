        <h3>65F. THE FIRST GREAT GROUP OF PARABLES.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">BESIDE THE SEA OF GALILEE.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>PARABLE OF THE TARES EXPLAINED.</h3>
        <h3>MATTHEW 13: 36-43.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">36</span> Then he left the multitudes, and went into the 
            house (<span class="comm">probably Simon Peter's house</span>): and his disciples came unto 
            him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">37</span> And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of 
            man;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">38</span> and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are 
            the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">39</span> and the enemy that 
            sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers 
            are angels.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">40</span> As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned 
            with fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">41</span> The Son of 
            man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all 
            things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">42</span> and 
            shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the 
            gnashing of teeth.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">43</span> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the 
            sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear. (<span class="comm">This 
                parable and its explanation are sometimes urged as an argument against church 
                discipline, but such a use of them is clearly erroneous. The field is not the 
                church, but the world, and the teaching of the parable is that we are not to 
                attempt to exterminate evil men. Any who attempt to exterminate heretics in the 
                name of Christ by physical force are condemned by this parable.</span>)
