        <h3>97. PRAYER TAUGHT.</h3>
        <h3>(<span class="comm">PROBABLY JUD&AElig;A.</span>)</h3>
        <h3>LUKE 11: 1-13.</h3>
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">1</span> And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain 
            place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us 
            to pray, even as John also taught his disciples. (<span class="comm">Jesus had already taught 
                his disciples how to pray in the Sermon on the Mount. This disciple probably 
                thought that the prayer already taught was too brief to be sufficient, 
                especially as Jesus often prayed so long. It was customary for the rabbis to 
                give their disciples forms of prayer, and the Baptist seems to have followed 
                this practice, though the prayer taught by him appears soon to have been 
                forgotten.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">2</span> And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, Hallowed be 
            thy name. Thy kingdom come.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">3</span> Give us day by day our daily 
            bread

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">4</span> And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one 
            that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation. (<span class="comm">The form given 
                by Matthew is fuller 

                than this. See pp. 252-254. The 
                variation of the two prayers is an evidence of the independence of the two 
                Gospels. In the prayer as usually publicly repeated, the word 
                "trespasses" is often used in place of the word 
                "debts." This is a remnant of Tyndale's translation (<span class="comm">A.D. 1526</span>) which has been preserved 
                and handed down in the Episcopal Liturgies. Tyndale renders Matthew as follows: 
                "And forgive us our trespases even as we forgive them which trespas 
                vs."</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">5</span> And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and 
            shall go unto him at midnight (<span class="comm">a most unseasonable hour</span>), and say 
            unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">6</span> for a friend of mine is 
            come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him (<span class="comm">In the 
                summer Orientals often travel by night to avoid the heat of the day, and the 
                customs of the land then made hospitality so obligatory that the greatest 
                inconvenience and deepest poverty did not excuse one from practicing it. The 
                occasion here described would call for three loaves, that the host and the 
                guest might each have one, and that there might be one in reserve as an 
                evidence of liberality</span>);

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">7</span> and he from within shall answer and say, 
            Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I 
            cannot rise and give thee? (<span class="comm">The man within does not use the word 
                "friend." His answer is blunt and discouraging. In the house of a 
                laboring man, the family all sleep in one room. The pallets, or thin 
                mattresses, are spread upon the divan, or raised platform, which passes around 
                the room next to the wall. Where there was no divan they were spread upon the 
                floor. For a father to rise and grope about in the dark that he might unbolt 
                the door and find the required bread was indeed no slight trouble. He would be 
                apt to step upon, or otherwise disturb, the sleeping children.</span>)

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">8</span> I say unto 
            you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because 
            of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth. 
            (<span class="comm">Friendship should have prompted the man to supply his friend. It failed, 
                however; yet the bread was given 

                to get rid of a noisy beggar, to 
                be rid of whom all the bread in the house would be willingly sacrificed if 
                necessary. If a selfish man can be thus won by importunity, much more can a 
                generous God, whose reluctance is never without reason, and whose ever-present 
                desire is to bless. Idle repetition of prayers is forbidden; but persistence 
                and importunity are encouraged. See <span class="style7">Isaiah 42: 6; Genesis 18: 23-33; Matthew 15: 27-28</span>.</span>)
        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">9</span> And I say unto you, 
            Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be 
            opened unto you.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">10</span>  For every one that asketh receiveth; and he 
            that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">11</span> And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give 
            him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">12</span> Or if he shall ask an egg, will 
            he give him a scorpion?

        <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style5">13</span> If ye then, being evil, know how to 
            give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to 
            them that ask him? (<span class="comm">The substance of this passage is recorded by Matthew as 
                a portion of the Sermon on the Mount. See pp. 264, 265. Matthew has "good things" where Luke has 
                "Holy Spirit." The Holy Spirit is the best of all gifts, being as 
                necessary to the soul as food to the body. The scorpion is an insect somewhat 
                similar to a small lobster. It is two or three inches long, and has a sting at 
                the end of its tail which is about as severe as that of a wasp. The old 
                commentators tell us that the white scorpion, when rolled up, closely resembled 
                an egg.</span>)
