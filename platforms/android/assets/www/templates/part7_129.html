                    <h1>The Passover Meal</h1>

                    <p>Before the feast of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('passover')">Passover</a>, Jesus knew that his hour had come that he should leave this world and go to the Father.</p>

                    <p>Now, Jesus loved his own who were in the world and he loved them to the end.</p>

                    <p>And during the supper Jesus knew that <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('satan')">Satan</a> had already entered Judas Iscariot and that he was plotting to betray him.</p>

                    <p>Jesus rose up from the supper and laid his garments aside and put a towel around his waist. Then he poured water into the basin and began to <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('anointfeet')">wash the disciples' feet</a>, and to wipe them with the towel that girded his waist.</p>

                    <p>When he came to Peter, Peter asked:</p>

                    <p>Lord are you planning to wash my feet?</p>

                    <p>Jesus answered him:</p>

                    <p>You do not understand what I am doing, but you will later.</p>

                    <p>Peter said to Jesus:</p>

                    <p>You will never wash my feet.</p>

                    <img src="img/firstemplewall.png" class="img-responsive" name="firstemplewall" title="firstemplewall" />
                    <p>Jesus answered him:</p>

                    <p>If I do not wash your feet, then you have nothing to do with me.</p>

                    <p>Peter said to the Lord:</p>

                    <p>Then do not just wash my feet, but wash my head and my hands as well as my feet.</p>

                    <p>Jesus said to Peter:</p>

                    <p>He who is bathed does not need anything washed but his feet. But is clean completely, and you are clean.</p>

                    <p>But not all of you are clean.</p>

                    <p>So Jesus washed their feet and then put his garment back on and returned to the table and sat with them.</p>

                    <p>And then Jesus said to them:</p>

                    <p>Do you understand what I have just done to you?</p>

                    <p>You call me Lord and <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('teacher')">Teacher</a>, and just as I have washed your feet you should also wash each others feet. I have given you an example of how you are to treat each other, just as I have done to you.</p>

                    <p>I want to tell you and important truth that you really need to understand. I tell you that a servant is not greater than his Lord, nor is the one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.</p>

                    <p>If you understand these things, then you are blessed when you do them.</p>

                    <p>I do not speak to all of you. I know the ones I have chosen.</p>

                    <p>But in order that <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">scripture</a> be fulfilled, He who eats my bread lifts up his heel against me.</p>

                    <p>I am telling you this before it happens so that when it does happen, you will believe that I am he.</p>

                    <p>The truth you really need to understand and pay attention to is that anyone who receives me also receives the one who sent me.
