                    <h3>Jesus Crucified </h3>

                    <p>It was the third hour and they <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('crucified')">crucified</a> him.</p>

                    <p>There were two others, both robbers and criminals, one on the right side and one of the left side of Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Jesus hung on a <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('cross')">cross</a> in the middle.</p>

                    <p>And Jesus said:</p>

                    <p>Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.</p>

                    <p>The soldiers had taken Jesus' garments and divided them between the four of them. When they came to his coat, which was woven from top to bottom and had no seams, they said:</p>

                    <p>Let's not tear it apart, but cast lots to see which one of us will keep it.</p>

                    <p>When they did this, they fulfilled the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('scripture')">scripture</a> that said:</p>

                    <p>They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</p>

                    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('pilate')">Pilate</a> wrote a title that he put above the cross. It said:</p>

                    <p>THIS IS JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

                    <img src="img/jeruarcheddoorway.png" class="img-responsive" name="jeruarcheddoorway" title="jeruarcheddoorway" />
                    <p>It was written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. And all the Jews who were in the city near the place where Jesus was crucified read the title.</p>

                    <p>The chief <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('priest')">priests</a> and the Jews of Jerusalem went to Pilate and said:</p>

                    <p>Do not write that he is the King of the Jews, but write that he says he is the king of the Jews.</p>

                    <p>Pilate answered:</p>

                    <p>I have written what I have written.</p>

                    <p>The people stood looking, and as they passed by they wagged their heads, saying:</p>

                    <p>Ha! Here is the one that is going to destroy the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('temple')">temple</a> and raise it up in three days. Save yourself if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross.</p>

                    <p>In like manner, the chief <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('priest')">priests</a> and the rulers scoffed and mocked him along with the scribes and the elders saying:</p>

                    <p>He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If this is the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('christ')">Christ</a> of God, his chosen, let him come down from the cross and we will see it and believe in him. He trusted God, let God deliver him if he wants to, for he said:</p>

                    <p>I am the Son of God.</p>

                    <img src="img/stonecross.png" class="img-responsive" name="stonecross" title="stonecross" />
                    <p>The soldiers also mocked him, offering him <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('vinegar')">vinegar</a> and saying:</p>

                    <p>If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.</p>

                    <p>The robbers who were being crucified with Jesus also reproached him. One of the criminals railed at him saying:</p>

                    <p>Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us.</p>

                    <p>The other robber who was also being crucified with Jesus said to his fellow criminal:</p>

                    <p>Don't you fear God, seeing that you are under the same condemnation. And we deserve this punishment for the things that we have done, but this man has done nothing wrong.</p>

                    <p>And then he said to Jesus:</p>

                    <p>Remember me when you come into your kingdom.</p>

                    <p>And Jesus said to him:</p>

                    <p>The truth is, today you will be with me in Paradise.</p>

                    <p>The mother of Jesus and her sister, along with Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene were standing by the cross.</p>

                    <p>When Jesus saw his mother and the <a href="javascript:void(0)" ng-click="popup('apostles')">disciple</a> whom he loved standing by, he said to his mother:</p>

                    <p>Woman, look, your son!</p>

                    <p>And he said to the disciple:</p>

                    <p>Behold, here is your mother!</p>

                    <p>From that hour on, the disciple took Mary into his own home.</p>
